Hi, I'm Jacob Shore! I am a kollel-guy-turned-software-engineer living in Beit Shemesh, Israel with my wife Chani, and our five boys בלי עין הרע. I plan to use this blog to write my random musings here. Write plans here to keep myself accountable.

Jacob's interests include:

- Torah
- technologies
- family
- music and banjo playing
- math
