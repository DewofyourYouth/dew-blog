Hi, I'm Jacob! I am a kollel-guy-turned-software-engineer living in Beit Shemesh, Israel with my wife Chani, and our five boys בלי עין הרע. I plan to use this blog to write my random musings and notes here.

My interests include:

- Torah
- [technologies](https://pangolinsoftwaresolutions.com)
- family
- music and banjo playing
- math
