## About Jacob

Hi, I'm Jacob! I am a kollel-guy-turned-software-engineer living in Beit Shemesh, Israel with my wife Chani, and our five boys בלי עין הרע. I plan to use this blog to write my random musings and notes here.

My interests include:

- Torah
- technologies
- family
- genealogy
- music and banjo playing
- math
- languages (programming and spoken)
- Toastmasters

## About The Name - Dew of your Youth

The name is based on Tehillim/Psalms chapter 110:3.
