## About Jacob

Hi, I'm Jacob—kollel-guy-turned-software-engineer living in Beit Shemesh with my wife Chani and our five boys (bli ayin hara). This space gathers the things I’m learning, building, and noticing.

What shows up here:

- Torah
- Languages: Tunisian Arabic, Judeo-Arabic, and programming languages
- Genealogy of the Shore/Saranduk family
- Building side projects and tooling
- Music (banjo) and the occasional math or public-speaking riff

## About The Name - Dew of your Youth

Taken from Tehillim/Psalms 110:3—“tal yaldutekha,” dew of your youth. It’s a reminder to stay curious and keep learning.

Fun fact: the gematria of “טל ילדותך” matches my Hebrew name, Yaakov Ephraim.
