## A List of Curated Genealogical Posts

This page collects selected essays from my genealogical research.

These posts are not exhaustive family trees, but case studies—built from records, memory, and the limits of both. I include only work where sources, uncertainties, and interpretive choices are made explicit.

### Recent Work: Fred Green

A focused reconstruction of Fredrick Philip Green’s life, tracing one family line across Sweden, Lithuania, and the United States, with attention to where records and family memory diverge.

### Yahrzeit Essays

Commemorative posts written on the yahrzeits of ancestors, using dates of remembrance as an entry point for careful biographical reconstruction.

###   The Saranduk Line

Source-driven posts tracing the Saranduk family from Talne through migration, name change, and divergence, with an emphasis on what the records support and where they fall short.
