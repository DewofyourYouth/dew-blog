As the new year of תשפ״ד comes closer and we find ourselves in the month on אלול. My resolutions for Elul through עשרת ימי תשובה:

1. Wake up and **daven with a minyan early**
   1. Go to bed by 23:00
   2. On days when I'm not davening on the train, daven with a minyan at 7 a.m. or earlier
   3. On days when davening I'm on the train, get the train that leaves a 7:46 a.m.
   4. Before davening, don't waste time watching movies, listening to podcasts, etc.
2. Read from a mussar sefer for at least 10 minutes a day.
   1. Ideally, the mussar should be related to waking up early / davening
3. Keep up with **daf hayomi** everyday during this period.
   1. Don't rely on making up days on Shabbos etc
   2. If it takes less then 1 hour to learn the whole daf with Rashi, either learn תוספות or review to complete **at least 1 hour** of learning day.
4. Be מחזק in last years resolution not to **lie**.
   1. Be מחזק in trying to avoid lying
   2. Take note of all lies, embellishments, or obfuscations said over a day. Even subtle ones.
   3. Write down the tally in obsidian and a spreadsheet at the end of the day.

May we all merit to כתיבה וחתימה טובה for the coming year 5784!
