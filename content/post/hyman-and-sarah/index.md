The oldest Saranduk we know to have emigrated from Russia (present day Ukraine) to America is Khaim Hersch Saranduk, known in America as Hyman Shore. This is a summary of what is known about him and his offspring.

The earliest document we have from Khaim Hersch is a 1858 Russian census document which says he was the son of Arvum (35) son of Khaim Saranduk. His mother‚Äôs name is Khaya (32). He is 9 years old and has a 6 year old brother named Moshe Yankel. He lives in Talne Ukraine. This puts the birth year of Khaim Hersch at approximately 1849.

The next document I‚Äôve found that he appears on is a record of his oldest known Shmarya (23) son of Khaim Hersch Saranduk to a Taube (18) daughter of Avraham Yudel Beresowsky. The event was to occur on August 18th, 1888.

Based on this, we can see that Khaim Hersch got married relatively young. He was apparently only 16 when he has his first child.

The next time he appears, it is on a ship manifest. The S.S. Gerty, in 1904. He is listed as being 55. His destination is listed as Buffalo, New York. He is traveling with two married women. His wife, Sura Saranduk , age 50, and Beila Saranduk, 30, the wife of his son Wolf Saranduk, who had emigrated two years earlier in 1902 and had taken up residence in Buffalo.

Shmarya‚Äôs (spelled Schmarje) family is also listed on the manifest, but their destination is listed as Providence, RI. Their contact there is listed as D. Berecowski. Taube‚Äôs uncle. Taube Saranduk (spelled Tube) is listed as being 33. Shmarya is listed as being 38.

Regarding Hyman‚Äôs wife Sarah (Sura), her death certificate lists her parent‚Äôs names as Allie and Bessia Mamorofsky. From her tombstone we know her father‚Äôs Hebrew name was Eliyahu. Her death certificate claims she was 61 years old at time of death on June 4, 1921. This would put date of birth sometime around 1860. This is not only inconsistent with the manifest record on the Gerty which has her as 50 years old in 1904 ( having her born in 1954), but I‚Äôm also pretty certain it‚Äôs biologically impossible to have a child at the age of 8 ( her oldest son Shmarya was born in 1968 ). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

There is also a death certificate for Hyman Shore having him living in Rhode Island at the time. The date on the death certificate in February 12, 1917. It lists his age at time of death as 57. If this is the death certificate for the same Hyman Shore (and all other facts check out) then the age is remarkably off by decade! He would have been around 68 years old given we know he was born in 1849. Perhaps there was some clerical practice of rounding to 1860 when the exact birth year was unknown?

Another thing to note. For all secular things his name was either Hyman or Khaim Hersch. For religious things he went by Chaim Tzvi ( Tzvi is the Hebrew version of Hersch ).
