The death of my Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Aaron Schechter זצ״ל came as a shock yesterday. He hadn't been well for many years, and it was very hard to get in to see him. His memory was not what it used to be towards the end - I guess I had a lot of excuses for not staying in touch. The news of his passing hit me like a ton of bricks. It had been 8 years since I had last spoken with him.

When I left the Yeshiva to study in Kolle Avodas HaLeviim (Ner Israel) in Baltimore, the Rosh Yeshiva told me "Yankel, you're not leaving Chaim Berlin, you're bringing Chaim Berlin to Baltimore!" At this time of great loss, I try to to console myself by telling myself that I didn't leave the Rosh Yeshiva, I bring him with me every day. I'm not going to be so pretentious as to claim to be a _talmid_ of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל, his _talmidim_ are great scholars and leaders of כלל ישראל. But when I was learning in Yeshiva Chaim Berlin, his presence demanded greatness from us! In consoling myself, I want to relate some personal stories I had with the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״לֹ that I take with me every day.

## The Back Story

When I came to Chaim Berlin, at age 22, I wasn't your typical Chaim Berliner. Now, anyone who knows anything about Chaim Berlin will be rolling their eyes at this statement because to be a "typical" Chaim Berliner, you need to have gone to Chaim Berlin in preschool! So I guess what I mean to say is that I wasn't a typical Yeshiva bochur at all. My Yeshiva high school education ended with my being kicked out of Mesivta of Boston in December of my 12th-grade year. From then on I wandered around, enrolling and dropping out of various Yeshivas and Universities. Eventually, I found work as a video editor. At this point, I considered myself to be "an agnostic" and found myself drifting away from religious observance altogether. A dangerous situation involving a car prompted me to make a commitment to return to Yeshiva and give G-d "another try" if I survived. When I did survive, I immediately regretted making such a commitment. Even so, I had made a deal, and I had to hold up my end of the bargain.

When I first contacted Rabbi Eliezer Fireman, my 10th-grade rebbe, I asked him how I could get into Lakewood. When he heard the nature of the deal I had made, he told me that he didn't think Lakewood was a good fit for me. He thought I would find it "stifling" and that Yeshivas Chaim Berlin would be a better fit. And so it was, that I called the Yeshiva to inquire about admissions, dusted off an old גמרא and prepared something to be tested on.

## My First Encounter With The Rosh Yeshiva

In most cases, you can't get accepted to a Yeshiva, without meeting with, and getting approved by, the Rosh Yeshiva. I was the exception. The day I came to be tested the Rosh Yeshiva was moving. As such, I was interviewed by his son, the Mashgiach of the yeshiva, Rabbi Mordechai Schechter.

On the first day of Yeshiva, I got up early, made myself tea, and started heading down towards the בית מדרש for שחרית. When I got to the lobby of the Yeshiva, I encountered the Rosh Yeshiva. The Rosh Yeshiva approached me.

"Good morning, who are you?"

"I'm Yaakov Shore, I'm a new student in the yeshiva", I replied.

"Yaakov, where did you find that tea?", the Rosh Yeshiva inquired.

The Rosh Yeshiva pointed to the tea in my hand. I found this question to be odd, but it was way earlier than I was used to being awake at that time and I couldn't be bothered to try to figure out what he was getting at.

"Downstairs", I said.

"Then drink it downstairs", the Rosh Yeshiva said with a smile.

The Rosh Yeshiva was not keen on people standing around in the Yeshiva lobby, drinking coffee.

## The Shabbos Table

Chaim Berlin is a relatively big yeshiva. But because it is an "in-town" yeshiva, it doesn't offer meals on Shabbos. An "in-town" yeshiva used to mean a yeshiva in New York, although I'm told now it increasingly means a yeshiva in Lakewood. Either way, I was from New England, which placed me squarely "out of town". As such, I had to go to people's houses for Shabbos meals.

I soon found out that the Rosh Yeshiva there were 8 spots for students to eat at the Rosh Yeshiva's house for Shabbos meals open every week. I thought that would be interesting. In day-to-day yeshiva life, you don't have much direct contact with the Rosh Yeshiva. I also assumed there would be a long waiting list, so I went to the person in charge of arranging the guests and quickly asked to be put on the list. When he asked me which meal I wanted, I told him it didn't matter, whichever was available first. He then clarified with me that was asking which meal I wanted to go to **that Shabbos**. Can I go to both?

At thought perhaps it was a fluke that there were available spots for that Shabbos. What I discovered was that the Rosh Yeshiva's Shabbos table was not a typical Shabbos table experience. Most students preferred a normal Shabbos table experience.
