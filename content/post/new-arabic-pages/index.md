Hey there!

Recently, I've taken an interest in studying Arabic and starting using this blog for my notes and to document my progress. Indeed, since Operation Rising Lion, I've been writing a daily reflection in Tunisian.

It quickly became apparent the Tunisian Arabic was going to canabalize the blog entirely. As such, I decided to create 2 new page, one for my [daily reflection in Derja](/page/derja), and the other containing all my [Arabic notes](/page/arabic) (includes the reflections as well). In addition to this, the daily reflections are so short - it is cumbersome to go to the designated posts - all the content will be readable from the daily derja reflection page.

In the future, **Arabic notes will be hidden from the general homepage and feeds** and will be available from the designated pages.
