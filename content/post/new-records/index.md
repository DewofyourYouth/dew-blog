Some new records from the Ukrainian Revision Lists related to Talne, have recently been added to the JewishGen database, they've written about it in a [recent blog post](https://www.jewishgen.org/blog/?p=ukraine-research-division). I checked and found some new Saranduk records. Some of these records add some new details and definition to the Saranduk family tree.

In the [last post](/post/hyman-and-sarah/) I wrote that previously the first know record of Khaim Hersh Saranduk (Hyman Shore) was this 1858 census:

**Location**: Talnoye, Uman, Kyiv \
**Surname**: Saranduk \
**Year**: 1858

| Name         | Role              | Gender | Age | Father's Name |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------ | --- | ------------- |
| Avrum        | Head of household | M      | 34  | Khaim         |
| Khaim Hersh  | Son               | M      | 9   | Avrum         |
| Moshe Yankel | Son               | M      | 6   | Avrum         |
| Khaya        | Wife of Avrum     | F      | 32  |               |

Well, a 1850 record was just added revealing that Khaim Hersh had an older sister named Malka:

**Location**: Talnoye, Uman, Kyiv \
**Surname**: Saranduk \
**Year**: 1850

| Name  | Role              | Gender | Age | Father's Name |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------ | --- | ------------- |
| Avrum | Head of household | M      | 26  | Khaim         |
| Gersh | Son               | M      | 1   | Avrum         |
| Khaya | Wife              | F      | 23  |               |
| Malka | Daughter          | F      | 6   | Avrum         |

There is another record from 1897 where we find some interesting details about Shmarya Shore.

**Location**: Talnoye, Uman, Kyiv \
**Surname**: Saranduk \
**Year**: 1887

| Name           | Role              | Gender | Age | Father's Name |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --- | ------------- |
| Avrum\*        | Head of Household | M      | 75  | Khaim Gershko |
| Khaya          | Wife of Avrum     | F      | 70  | Mot           |
| Shmariy        | Grandson          | M      | 28  | Khaim Gershko |
| Tuba           | Wife of Shmariy   | F      | 25  | Avrum Yudko   |
| Peysya         | Relative          | F      | 8   | Shmariya      |
| Duvid Leyb     | Relative          | M      | 4   | Shmariya      |
| Volko          | Relative          | M      | 1/2 | Shmariya      |
| Pysenko, Khana | Sister            | F      | 65  | Gershko       |

_\* NOTE: that the transcript on has the name of Avrum as Аврум Хаим (Avrum Khaim), but from what I can tell from the original image, the father's name is determined from a patrynomic (Avrum Khaim Gershkovitch). I think the transcriber assumed that it was Avrum-Khaim Gershkovitch as opposed to Avrum Khaim-Gershkovitch. However, my inability efficiently to read Cyrillic handwriting has prevented me from further investigating this._
