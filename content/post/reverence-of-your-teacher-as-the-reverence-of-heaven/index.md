> Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua said: let the honor of your student be as dear to you as your own, and the honor of your colleague as the reverence for your teacher, and the reverence for your teacher as the reverence of heaven.

[From Avos Chapter 4, Mishna 12 - Translation by Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.4.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)

This is the second post in a series about my Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Aaron Schechter זצ״ל. I want to stress again, that I am neither qualified nor capable of writing a biography of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל. The Rosh Yeshiva's memory should not be confined to the musings of Lilliputians like myself. I am just recording my memories and the life lessons I learned whilst being blessed to live in the presence of a giant such as the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל.

## Rejoice with Trembling

If you've got the impression from my previous post, that the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל was a warm and cuddly Zeide figure, I'm afraid I've misled you. The protocols of decorum towards one's Rosh Yeshiva in Chaim Berlin were extreme, even for regular Yeshivas. I'm told this was put in place by the previous Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Yitzchak Hutner זצ״ל. The Rosh Yeshiva was revered and feared by all. And he didn't suffer fools gladly. Even so, the love that he had for his students was felt by us at all times. He was known for having a smile that would light up the room. He was also known for the direct and no-holds-barred way he could express his disapproval.

Critics of religion will often note the contradictory nature of the commandment to fear G-d, and the commandment to love G-d. Students of the Rosh Yeshiva have no problem appreciating how this is no contradiction at all. Because we felt the love of the Rosh Yeshiva, as well as his greatness of character, our love for him caused us to fear disappointing him even more.

## Unworthy Questions

I've never asked him, but I would imagine Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל was not a fan of the saying "There's no such thing as a stupid question". Firstly, the word stupid is not a word that ever left the lips of the Rosh Yeshiva. He would view such verbiage as coarse and unbecoming of a Torah Jew. But more to the point, the Rosh Yeshiva would lambaste students for asking, shall we say, 'unworthy' questions all the time.

A type of question the Rosh Yeshiva had particular contempt for was the lazy question. Where the questioner blurts out a question because he can't be bothered to expend the necessary mental resources to come up with the apparent solution himself. The Rosh Yeshiva saw his role as facilitating a student's deeper understanding and thoughts in Torah. He was not going to do the thinking for you.

There was a certain student whom the Rosh Yeshiva loved dearly and took under his wing, who he felt was guilty of this laziness to a certain degree. In trying to rid him of this habit, he would dismiss questions asked by this person with verbal carnage that made everyone in the room uncomfortable. Once he even kicked this person out of the room for asking a question. He then told everyone else present, when he saw us all, mouths agape in horror, that he did this "because he is a good man, and I can be sure that when he comes back he will be a greater man." (I'm not certain about the exact wording the Rosh Yeshiva used, but it was along those lines.)

If you're worried about this person, it is true what the Rosh Yeshiva said about him. He did come back a greater man. I never received anything near that level of harsh treatment. The Rosh Yeshiva knew I wouldn't be able to handle it.

## Respect for all Students

One thing needs to be made clear. While the Rosh Yeshiva could be harsh in response to a question or a behavior, he would _never_ treat a student himself with disrespect. He took umbrage with referring to the _talmidim_ as "guys". Someone telling the Rosh Yeshiva that "so-and-so is a good guy", would get a lecture about how the word "guy" is a diminutive term.

In Parashas Berieshis, the Rosh Yeshiva noted on the verse (Genesis 2:15):

> And G-d took the Adam and placed him in the garden of Eden...

Where Rashi quotes the Medrash which explains that it doesn't mean he picked him up and placed him in the Garden, but rather that he convinced him with words.

"How did חז״ל know this?", the Rosh Yeshiva asked, "How does he know the meaning isn't simply that He picked him up and placed Adam in the garden!?"

The Rosh Yeshiva answered, "because the verb 'to take' means different things in different contexts. A man is not a sack of potatoes that you pick of here and place here. When referring to men, 'to take' means with words. This is the simple reading of the _passuk_."
