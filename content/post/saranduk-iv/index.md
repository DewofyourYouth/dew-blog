This post his going to be a summary of Hyman Shore and his descendants based on my research. Of the Shore's that migrated to America, I've really only been able to find the records of the two son's of Avraham Saranduk, Khaim Hersch and Moshe Yankel. It's certainly plausable that the Mordko side also wound up emigrating, but I haven't found the records yet. We know that Khaim Hersch Saranduk changed his name to Hyman Shore. I'm just going to spell out some of the details on Hyman Shore and his family:

### Hyman & Sarah Shore

   - Originally went to stay with his son Wolf, in Buffalo, NY - but ended up in Providence, RI.
   - Died in February 1912.
   - Buried in Lincoln Park Cemetery, Warwick, RI.
2. Sara _Mamorofsky_ Shore
   - Born in Russia (details unknown) to Allie and Bessia Mamorofsky in approximately 1860 (based on the death that claims she was 61 years old at time of death).
