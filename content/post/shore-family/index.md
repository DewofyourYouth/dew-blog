## Shore / Saranduk Family

It would seem that in Ukraine our family name was Saranduk, but that this name was given by the Ukrainian ( or Russian ) authorities and used mostly for government documents etc. Not accepted by the family, who seemed to go by Shore.

The reason I think this is because this is what I’ve been told by Aunt Ruth, who was something of the family genealogist. She claims she was told this by her father, Samuel Oscar / Asher Shore. The claim checks out to me for two reasons:

1. I’ve found other cases of Jewish people who were named Saranduk immediately changed their surname to Shore upon arrival in to America (a Shore family in Missouri), with no known relationship or correspondence with our part of the family, which I take as evidence that they were in the same family.
2. All documents I found were of a government nature. Ukrainian census documents and Ellis Island ship manifests. I’ve never seen in any other context that a family member is referred to as Saranduk.

Aunt Ruth claimed her father told her they were given the surname Saranduk as a form of shaming by the Russians and as such didn’t keep it in America. I have asked native Russian and Ukrainian speakers who all claim there is no meaning to the name Saranduk.

## Russian 1858 Census Document

We were able to find a 1858 Census document from Talne, Uman, Ukraine - which seems to contain the members of our family as Saranduk. The data in this census matches the data we found from ship logs, tombstones, and other records, to be identify the child named as Chaim Hershel - as Hyman Shore.

The census data says:

Location: Talnoye, Uman, Kyiv
Surname: Saranduk
Year: 1858

## Lincoln Park Cemetery, Warwick, RI

There are 2 generations of Shores buried in Lincoln Park Cemetery in Warwick, RI

### Hyman (Tzvi) and Sarah Shore

1.  Hyman:
    1. חיים צבי ב״ר אברהם שאר.
    2. Died Feb, 12, 1912 3. נפטר כ׳ שבט תרע״ז 4. Hebrew date and English date do not match. Hebrew date suggests that the date of death was Feb 12, 1917 (_not_ 1912).
    3. Find A Grave claims that Hyman was born in 1860. I do not not what the source for this is. I have found a [Ukrainian census record from 1858](https://www.jewishgen.org/databases/jgdetail_2.php?df=668804e1-5ba5-4884-b98a-263691a3f226&georegion=00ukraine&srch1=Saranduk%20&srch1v=S&srch1t=Q&srchbool=AND&dates=all&newwindow=0&recstart=0&recjump=0&saved=1) which reported has a household were someone name Avrum Saranduk in Tolne has a son name Khaim Ghersh (חיים הירש) is a variant of חיים צבי who is 9 years old. This would make him born in 1849 (11 years prior). This birth date checks out with the ship manifests which claim he was 55 in 1904.
    4. Inscription on tombstone: Our honored father, A man of modest ways, God fearing, Sabbath observer, beloved to all
    5. אבינו הנכבד איש הצנע לכת ירא שמים שומר שבת אהוב לבריות.
2.  Sarah:
    1. שרה בת ר׳ אליהו
    2. Died June 4th 1921
    3. Poetic non typical(?) tombstone inscription based on Song of Songs
    4. אמינו החביבה דגולה מרבבה ודגלה עלינו אהבה Our beloved mother, (an) exceptional (person), showered us with love. (Rough translation, both דגול מרבבה and דלגו עלי אהבה are from Song of Songs)
3.  There is a paper cutting, made by their son Sam / Shmaryahu Shore, preserved at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which commemorates the his parents, which commemorates the same dates of their passing.
4.  They seems to have had at least two other children besides Sam / Shmaryahu, also buried at Lincoln Park Cemetery:

    2. [Rose / Raizel (Shore) Grossman](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/202408296/rose-shore-grossman)
