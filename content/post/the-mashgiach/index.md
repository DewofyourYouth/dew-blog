After the devastating news of the passing of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל, the news that the משגיח, Rabbi Mordechai Zelig Schechter זצ״ל has passed just a few short weeks later, is a lost that brings to mind the the verse in Yishaiah

> על מה תכו עוד תוסיפו סרה כל ראש לחלי וכל לבב \
> On what part can you yet be stricken? Seeing you stray away more and more! The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;

The Rosh Yeshiva, the one who sits at the head of the yeshiva, and the Mashgiach, the heart of the yeshiva, have been struck in such a short time. Oy! How far have we strayed to stricken like this!?

Unfortunately, the passing of the משגיח זצ״ל didn’t come as a total surprise. He had a prolonged two year battle with cancer ר״ל.

In some ways it’s impossible to discuss the Mashgiach זצ״ל without also discussing his father זצ״ל . In many ways he was the embodiment of the teachings of Rav Hunter זצ״ל and his father. But the contrast of demeanor between the Mashgiach and his father could not have been more stark. The Rosh Yeshiva was someone who was to be approached with awe, and who the burden was on the talmid to _shtell tzu_, to put in the effort to understand what he was saying and live up to his standards. The Mashgiach on the other hand, could speak to anyone on their level. He knew how to speak נגד רוחו של כל אדם. To distill all the depth of the worlds of his father and Rav Hunter זצ״ל into something that we could relate to on whatever low level we were at.

The humility of the Mashgiach was something to behold. He wouldn’t put on airs or make you feel small when talking to him. Every conversation I had with him left me feel edified and like I had just gained insight. But also,I always had the feeling that the Mashgiach had enjoyed talking with me as much I enjoyed talking to him. I don’t think I was just fooled by his kind demeanor. I think the Mashgiach genuinely loved his _talmidim_ that way.

My relationship with the Mashgiach started on the day he let me into the Yeshiva. He encouraged me to come to Chaim Berlin and had encouraged my learning and personal growth ever since.

But the Mashgiach was not only a source of support, he was also a source of inspiration. He was a poetic soul and a deep thinker who was always there to share his insights. When I was developing my own ideas and thoughts, he was always keen to discuss and refine them with me.

Some examples of his poetic nature and encouragement:

When I came to Chaim Berlin, in the middle of the zman, I thought if I got accepted I would be allowed to come next zman. The Mashgiach told to go home, pack my bags, and come immediately. If he hadn’t done that, who knows if I would’ve ever made good on my commitment to go to Chaim Berlin.

He once told me that it was important that I realize what I was. That I was a fresh breeze that came in blowing the dust off of these old seforim (pointing to the Chaim Berlin library).

At one point he was sick in bed with the flu for a week. When he came back he came and sat next to me during first seder to share with me that, during the time he was in bed he was meditating on the מהר״ל (גור אריה) on the verse מקדש ה׳ כוננו ידיך - that something done with two hands is something you put your whole self into. “Hashem doesn’t ask us to subjugate ourselves to him up become lifeless, passionless, passive automatons. Hashem wants us to serve him with **both hands**! With vigor and passion, full of life and power! Like knights on galloping horses, charging full speed towards the enemy full of strength and force of will!!” He then apologized for disturbing me during Seder on account of wanting to share that with me. (NOTE: I don’t remember what the גור אריה actually said, this is just my account of what משגיח זצ״ל said)

I used to try to go to the Mashgiach’s home for סעודה שלישית where he would generally wax philosophically. I’m certain that many of my life insights were formed from those times.

1. The change of yeshivas attitude to secular studies is due to ירידת הדורות. In the past, a person could get a broad mindedness just from Torah. Nowadays, that of no longer the case.
2. Yeshiva bochrim who get involved in reading fantasy books (like Harry Potter) will have a harder time becoming talmidei chochmim.

When his brother in law passed suddenly, the Mashgiach took his young children to raise in his home. He would walk every Shabbos to boro park to make kiddush for his window and give attention to his other children. I remember that once, when I had engaged, I needed discuss something with him, I had the opportunity to accompany him on this walk to Boro Park. It was a truly uplifting experience.
