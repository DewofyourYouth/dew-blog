I recently celebrated my 40th birthday. At work, someone asked me how I celebrated my birthday. I briefly misunderstood the question to be how _can_ I celebrate my birthday? I decided to just go with it?

"Do you mean how can I possibly celebrate when I'm just one year closer to death?"

Yeah, I'm a laugh riot.

Seems like it's a tradition amongst men turning 40 to sort of do accounting of their life and determine that the next best step is to buy a new sports car and dye their hair.
It still remains to be seen what I'm going to do on that front.

I've been feeling rather tired lately. I seem to have moved the needle, and remarkable so, on many things over the past decade. My situation has improved in many ways.
Other things have gotten worse. Everything has its cost. Am I running in place?

Some big things are changing in my life now. I'm trying to pack and move apartments and my oldest son going to Yeshiva Ketana next year.
I'm starting to appreciate all sorts of clichés about "life going by so fast". Yes! it's becoming rather intolerable.
