His Hebrew name was Mordechai Zev. Married [[Bella Sarles]] in Talne. He died in California on March 12th, 1943 at age 69.

Here is a photograph of the Migration record from 1902 where Wolf Saranduk claims he is moving to Buffalo, NY to join an uncle (S. Morison?)

It lists his profession as a tailor. That is the profession listed for all Saranduk men (as far as I know).

On his death certificate it says he had a Jewelry Shop in California. I donâ€™t know much about how he wound up so far away from the rest of the Saranduk family, or why he changed his name to Serin (sometimes Serrin) instead of Shore (although it does seem somewhat closer to the original).
