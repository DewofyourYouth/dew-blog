First update on progress on the Elul logs. I said I would do biweekly updates - but in retrospect - that is a but much. Once a week should be more than enough to include all the relevant information.

## Attendance: How many times did I show up?

So far, I did the mediation 6x and missed one day (August 28). So my attendence is 86%.

## Some Thoughts

I haven't had a chance to run it by the Rebbe like I said I would but so far I've had some thoughts. The first one being, I'm not great at this meditation thing! ðŸ˜…

### The Order

So to be honest - just to kick things off - I started out with a template I just asked ChatGPT for.

It was basically a script like this:

---
1. **Settle**

> I stop. I breathe. I turn my mind toward Hashem.

2. **Acknowledge**

> Everything I have is from You.

3. **Name Three Gifts (concrete, today)**

> I thank You for ___ [first thing].
> I thank You for ___ [second thing].  
> I thank You for ___ [third thing].

4. **Seal**

> With these gifts, You remind me of Your kindness and love. I begin my day in gratitude.

You can rotate the three gifts each day. Keep them **small and specific** (a good sleep, a working pen, your childâ€™s smile). 

---

Good enough I suppose, but I'm started to think that perhaps the focus on the thankfulness need to preceded with the focus on the love - as well as at the end. Otherwise, it very much a "quid pro quo" sort of meditation.
