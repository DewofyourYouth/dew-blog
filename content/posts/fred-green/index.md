## Intro

I want to dedicate some time to writing about my paternal grandmother’s grandfather, part of **Roberta (Green) Shore’s** family line. My grandmother recently turned 100 years old, though her condition is not good. While reviewing family records, I noticed that his _yahrzeit_ falls on the third night of Hanukkah. This past Hanukkah marked his 86th _yahrzeit_.

Despite several surname changes over the generations, my grandmother’s family early history is documented in a genealogical work titled [_The Propp Family History_](https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Propp_Family_History.html?id=QdiGrgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y), by David-Hillel Ruben and Henry W. Propp. I do not own the book myself, but I have been able to consult portions of it thanks to the generosity of a distant relative (_name withheld_).

Based on what I have seen in The Propp Family History, Myer Propp fled Shkudvil, Lithuania sometime in the nineteenth century, eventually settling in Sweden. Upon leaving Lithuania, he changed his name to Myer Greenberg. He is associated in later records with a wife, Rachel (Pikin). It is unclear whether they fled together as a married couple or whether Myer emigrated as a bachelor and married Rachel after settling in Sweden.

## Early Life

It was there, in Sweden, that their son **Fredrick Philip (Fred) Greenberg** was born in August 1865. His exact birthdate is not consistent across sources. In sworn testimony given during his naturalization process, Fred stated that he was born on **17 August 1865**, while his tombstone records his birthdate as **10 August 1865**. His Hebrew name, _Shraga Feivel_, is preserved on the tombstone.

In **1871**, Fred emigrated to the United States with his family, a date likewise supported by his sworn naturalization testimony. Depending on the exact date of arrival (only the year of arrival is recorded), he would have been five or six years old at the time. According to family memory, he retained the ability to speak Swedish later in life. His surname was shortened to **Green** at some point before his Naturalization Testimony, taken in **September of 1895**.

{{<admonition type=note >}}
The variation between the surnames **Green** and **Greenberg** remains unclear. For example, in the Boston birth register, Goldie and Israel are recorded under the surname *Green*, while in the undertaker’s return filed eight months later the family name appears as *Greenberg*. Such inconsistencies may reflect informal name usage or clerical variation rather than a deliberate change, but the exact reason is not yet documented.

## Marriage, Career and Children

He married **Sarah Libby Cohen**, a New York native, in 1890 and worked as a photographer. Family recollections add further, though sometimes imprecise, details. At one point I believed that Fred Green had been involved in lobbying the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to require photographs on driver’s licenses, but I now think this was a mistaken inference, likely arising from his long association with police identification photography.

Other family memories, however, remain unresolved. According to my father, Fred owned early cinemas in Boston, though I have not yet been able to locate documentary evidence to confirm this claim. It is nonetheless notable that Fred’s oldest daughter, **Anne Green**, married **Samuel Pianski**, a recognized pioneer in early New England movie theaters. While this connection does not establish ownership, it situates the family within circles closely tied to the early cinema industry.

While best documented for his twenty-six years as the official photographer of the Boston Police Department, Fred Green also maintained a civilian photography practice. Contemporary accounts describe him as well known in theatrical circles, and archival photographs attributed to him include documentation of Jewish lifecycle events such as bar mitzvahs. Taken together, these sources suggest a professional life that extended beyond police identification photography into private, communal, and cultural settings.

His obituary records that he was survived by one daughter, **Anne**, and two sons, **Irving** and **Maurice**. Civil records, however, show that Irving was a twin, and that his twin sister, **Goldie**, died in infancy in 1895 and is therefore not mentioned in the obituary.

It is noteworthy that Boston civil records are inconsistent in their recording of the parents’ origins. In one record, Fred and Sarah are listed as having come from Poland, while a death certificate records their origins as Russia. Neither designation aligns with other documentation, which shows that Fred was born in Sweden and Sarah was American-born. These discrepancies likely reflect the broad and imprecise manner in which Jewish origins were recorded in late nineteenth-century Boston, rather than the actual biographical facts of the family.

His Yahrzeit is Kislev 27, 5700.
