summary: What I do when a word refuses to stick‚Äîwhy brute force fails, and how I hack the brain‚Äôs tagging system.
---

Most vocabulary doesn‚Äôt need tricks. If you review it in context, see it in sentences, and hear it in conversation, it eventually sticks. That‚Äôs the spacing effect at work ([Ebbinghaus, 1885/1913](https://archive.org/details/memorycontributi00ebbiuoft); [Cepeda et al., 2006](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf)). But every learner knows the stubborn few‚Äîthe words you‚Äôve looked up ten times and *still* forget. That‚Äôs when I switch to deliberate hacks. I use them in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and include them in spaced repetition.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: the *act of inventing* the mnemonic is as important as the cue itself. Psychologists call this the **generation effect** ([Slamecka & Graf, 1978](https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.4.6.592)). When you make the association yourself, the effort of construction strengthens the memory more than just reading someone else‚Äôs idea.

## Examples: how I hack sticky words

Here are three mnemonics I deliberately created for Tunisian Arabic words that wouldn‚Äôt stick‚Äî**and that interfered with each other**.

### Sitting ‚Äî ŸÇŸéÿßÿπŸêÿØŸí (*9ad*)
{{< image src="/sit.jpeg" caption="A cartoon of sitting on a **cod** (a type of fish in English). Cod ‚Üí 9ad." >}}


### Sleeping ‚Äî ÿ±ŸÇÿØ (*r9ad*)

{{< image src="/sleep.jpeg" caption="A woman dancing in her sleep. In Hebrew, *rakkad* = ‚Äúdance,‚Äù which sounds like *r9ad* (sleep). " >}}

### Finding ‚Äî ŸÑŸÇŸâ (*l9a*)


{{< image src="/find.jpeg" caption="A woman using a **Q-shaped magnifying glass** to **find** a clicker. The magnifying glass cues *find*, and the clicker reinforces the ‚Äúclick‚Äù in *l-QA*." >}}

### Why these three needed extra help (interference)
These forms tripped me up because they‚Äôre **phonologically similar**: **9ad**, **r9ad**, **l9a**. The mnemonics are designed to **pull them apart**:
- **9ad (sit)** ‚Üî **cod** (static, seated).
- **r9ad (sleep)** ‚Üî **rakkad** (dance) ‚Üí absurd *sleep-dance* image.
- **l9a (find)** ‚Üî **Q magnifier + clicker** (explicit *search* + the final ‚Äúclick‚Äù).

## Sometimes the best mnemonics come by accident

Not all mnemonics need to be carefully designed. Sometimes the best ones just happen.

A while back, while talking with my tutor Arij, she told me she‚Äôs often impatient and always shouting at her friends:  
> ‚ÄúFeesa! Feesa!‚Äù (*Hurry up!*)

That single anecdote stuck better than a thousand rote memorization drills. Now, whenever I hear the word **ŸÅŸäÿ≥ÿ© (*feesa*)**, I don‚Äôt just see text on a card‚ÄîI hear Arij‚Äôs voice in my head, yelling *Feesa! Feesa!* at her slow friend. ü§£

This is the power of a **personal story**: it links the word to a vivid, emotional, socially grounded memory. Because it came with humor, context, and a real person, it carved a deeper pathway than any flashcard could. Before that, I had forgotten the word many many times, now I can instantly recall it.

## Why brute force fails

- **Low salience:** Some words don‚Äôt appear often enough in your input to build natural hooks.  
- **Interference:** Similar-sounding words overwrite each other.  
- **Shallow processing:** Just writing a translation drills form but not meaning.  

When brute force fails, you need to deliberately give the brain a reason to keep the word.

## What makes things memorable: attention & arousal

Memory isn‚Äôt neutral‚Äîit‚Äôs selective. The brain prioritizes what grabs attention and what carries emotional or biological weight.

- **Von Restorff effect:** distinctiveness makes outliers stand out ([Hunt, 1995](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03214414.pdf)).  
- **Arousal strengthens memory:** emotional stimuli are remembered more strongly ([Kensinger, 2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00506.x)).  
- **Visual salience:** symmetry, movement, and exaggeration hijack attention ([Itti & Koch, 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35058500)).  

This explains why mnemonics that are *funny, shocking, vivid, or absurd* work better than neutral ones. They force the brain to tag the word as ‚Äúimportant.‚Äù

## Why I often pick characters

Characters outperform abstract symbols for attention. There‚Äôs solid evidence that **faces and bodies draw more attention than objects** ([Downing et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15110728/); [Palermo & Rhodes, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393206001655)), and that **exaggerated features (caricatures) are especially sticky** ([Rhodes, Brennan, & Carey, 1987](https://www.harvardlds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rhodes-Identification-and-ratings-of-caricatures-implications-for-mental-representations-of-faces..pdf)).

A specific attentional bias matters here too: eye-tracking shows **men fixate quickly and longer on hourglass-shaped female figures** ([Singh, 1993](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/roney/james/other%20pdf%20readings/Singh%2520Adaptive%2520Significance%2520of%2520WHR.pdf); [Dixson et al., 2011](https://canlabvuw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eye-tracking-of-men_s-preferences-for-waist-to-hip-ratio-and-breast-size-of-women.pdf)). Use that bias if it helps you remember.

## Techniques I actually use

1. **Shock value** ‚Äì break a taboo, be jarring.  
2. **Humor & absurdity** ‚Äì cartoonify the meaning; the sillier, the better.  
3. **Sound-alikes** ‚Äì hijack familiar words (English/Hebrew/etc.).  
4. **Personal references** ‚Äì tie the word to people or stories I already know.  
5. **Characters** ‚Äì exploit attentional bias toward faces and bodies.  
6. **Mini-stories** ‚Äì turn the word into a 1‚Äì2 panel comic.

## The act of making is the memory

- **Generation effect:** creating your own associations boosts recall ([Slamecka & Graf, 1978](https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.4.6.592)).  
- **Levels of processing:** deeper, more elaborate encoding = stronger memory ([Craik & Lockhart, 1972](https://wixtedlab.ucsd.edu/publications/Psych%20218/Craik_Lockhart_1972.pdf); [Craik & Tulving, 1975](https://alicekim.ca/CraikTulving1975.pdf)).  
- **Dual coding:** combining imagery + language strengthens recall ([Paivio, 1990](https://books.google.com/books/about/Mental_Representations.html?id=hLGmKkh_4K8C)).  

Even if the cue is crude or clumsy, constructing it yourself embeds the word deeper than repetition alone.

---

## Iteration: keep or kill

Not every mnemonic lands. If I still blank on a word despite the cue, I replace it. The goal isn‚Äôt an Anki deck of dead jokes‚Äîit‚Äôs to *tag* the unstickiest words with a signal strong enough that forgetting them is harder than remembering.

---

## Bottom line

For 90% of vocabulary, ordinary review plus exposure works. But for the 10% that resist, brute force fails. That‚Äôs when I hack the system. I load the word with humor, absurdity, or vivid characters, because those force attention. The effort of making the cue, plus the attentional tag, gives it a place in memory that plain repetition never will.

It‚Äôs a scalpel, not a hammer. And it works.
