Most vocabulary doesn’t need tricks. If you review it in context, see it in sentences, and hear it in conversation, it eventually sticks. That’s the spacing effect at work ([Ebbinghaus, 1885/1913](https://archive.org/details/memorycontributi00ebbiuoft); [Cepeda et al., 2006](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf)). But every learner knows the stubborn few—the words you’ve looked up ten times and *still* forget. That’s when I switch to deliberate hacks. I use them in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and include them in spaced repetition.

And here’s the kicker: the *act of inventing* the mnemonic is as important as the cue itself. Psychologists call this the **generation effect** ([Slamecka & Graf, 1978](https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.4.6.592)). When you make the association yourself, the effort of construction strengthens the memory more than just reading someone else’s idea.

{{< admonition type=note title="Editorial Note" open=true >}}
My friend [Dr. Franklin Zaromb PhD.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pjl80ZIAAAAJ&hl=en) pointed out that I neglected all the literature on retrieval and testing. He shared with me [some recent research](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/s44159-022-00089-1.pdf) showing that this is probably the *most* effective mnemonic of all.  

I’ve already covered how I use [Anki Cards](/post/tunisian-arabic-study/#anki-flashcards) and how I use [Lingualism](/post/language-learning-so-far/#tools-and-methods) cards for spaced repetition. I also run [The Daily Derja](https://dailyderja.com/about/#what-is-this-blog), where I try to post a few times a week, partly to force myself to retrieve Derja. So I think I have this somewhat covered.  

Still, it’s a significant omission from the memory literature I discussed—so I’m including this note here.

## Examples: how I hack sticky words

Here are three mnemonics I deliberately created for Tunisian Arabic words that wouldn’t stick—**and that interfered with each other**.
{{< admonition type=example title="Sitting — قَاعِدْ (*9ad*)" open=true >}}
{{< image src="/sit.jpeg" caption="A cartoon of sitting on a **cod** (a type of fish in English). Cod → 9ad." >}}
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=example title="Sleeping — رقد (*r9ad*)" open=true >}}
{{< image src="/sleep.jpeg" caption="A woman dancing in her sleep. In Hebrew, *rakkad* = “dance,” which sounds like *r9ad* (sleep). " >}}
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=example title="Finding — لقى (*l9a*)" open=true >}}
{{< image src="/find.jpeg" caption="A woman using a **Q-shaped magnifying glass** to **find** a clicker. The magnifying glass cues *find*, and the clicker reinforces the “click” in *l-QA*." >}}
{{< /admonition >}}


### Why these three needed extra help (interference)
These forms tripped me up because they’re **phonologically similar**: **9ad**, **r9ad**, **l9a**. The mnemonics are designed to **pull them apart**:
- **9ad (sit)** ↔ **cod** (static, seated).
- **r9ad (sleep)** ↔ **rakkad** (dance) → absurd *sleep-dance* image.
- **l9a (find)** ↔ **Q magnifier + clicker** (explicit *search* + the final “click”).

## Sometimes the best mnemonics come by accident

Not all mnemonics need to be carefully designed. Sometimes the best ones just happen.

{{< admonition type=example title="Hurry / Fast — فيسة (*feesa*)" open=true >}}

A while back, while talking with my tutor Arij, she told me she’s often impatient and always shouting at her friends:  
> “Feesa! Feesa!” (*Hurry up!*)

That single anecdote stuck better than a thousand rote memorization drills. Now, whenever I hear the word **فيسة (*feesa*)**, I don’t just see text on a card—I hear Arij’s voice in my head, yelling *Feesa! Feesa!* at her slow friend. 🤣

This is the power of a **personal story**: it links the word to a vivid, emotional, socially grounded memory. Because it came with humor, context, and a real person, it carved a deeper pathway than any flashcard could. Before that, I had forgotten the word many many times, now I can instantly recall it.

## Why brute force fails

- **Low salience:** Some words don’t appear often enough in your input to build natural hooks.  
- **Interference:** Similar-sounding words overwrite each other.  
- **Shallow processing:** Just writing a translation drills form but not meaning.  

When brute force fails, you need to deliberately give the brain a reason to keep the word.

## What makes things memorable: attention & arousal

Memory isn’t neutral—it’s selective. The brain prioritizes what grabs attention and what carries emotional or biological weight.

- **Von Restorff effect:** distinctiveness makes outliers stand out ([Hunt, 1995](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03214414.pdf)).  
- **Arousal strengthens memory:** emotional stimuli are remembered more strongly ([Kensinger, 2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00506.x)).  
- **Visual salience:** symmetry, movement, and exaggeration hijack attention ([Itti & Koch, 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35058500)).  

This explains why mnemonics that are *funny, shocking, vivid, or absurd* work better than neutral ones. They force the brain to tag the word as “important.”

## Why I often pick characters

Characters outperform abstract symbols for attention. There’s solid evidence that **faces and bodies draw more attention than objects** ([Downing et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15110728/); [Palermo & Rhodes, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393206001655)), and that **exaggerated features (caricatures) are especially sticky** ([Rhodes, Brennan, & Carey, 1987](https://www.harvardlds.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rhodes-Identification-and-ratings-of-caricatures-implications-for-mental-representations-of-faces..pdf)).

A specific attentional bias matters here too: eye-tracking shows **men fixate quickly and longer on hourglass-shaped female figures** ([Singh, 1993](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/roney/james/other%20pdf%20readings/Singh%2520Adaptive%2520Significance%2520of%2520WHR.pdf); [Dixson et al., 2011](https://canlabvuw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eye-tracking-of-men_s-preferences-for-waist-to-hip-ratio-and-breast-size-of-women.pdf)). Use that bias if it helps you remember.

## Techniques I actually use

1. **Shock value** – break a taboo, be jarring.  
2. **Humor & absurdity** – cartoonify the meaning; the sillier, the better.  
3. **Sound-alikes** – hijack familiar words (English/Hebrew/etc.).  
4. **Personal references** – tie the word to people or stories I already know.  
5. **Characters** – exploit attentional bias toward faces and bodies.  
6. **Mini-stories** – turn the word into a 1–2 panel comic.

## The act of making is the memory

- **Generation effect:** creating your own associations boosts recall ([Slamecka & Graf, 1978](https://doi.org/10.1037/0278-7393.4.6.592)).  
- **Levels of processing:** deeper, more elaborate encoding = stronger memory ([Craik & Lockhart, 1972](https://wixtedlab.ucsd.edu/publications/Psych%20218/Craik_Lockhart_1972.pdf); [Craik & Tulving, 1975](https://alicekim.ca/CraikTulving1975.pdf)).  
- **Dual coding:** combining imagery + language strengthens recall ([Paivio, 1990](https://books.google.com/books/about/Mental_Representations.html?id=hLGmKkh_4K8C)).  

Even if the cue is crude or clumsy, constructing it yourself embeds the word deeper than repetition alone.

---

## Iteration: keep or kill

Not every mnemonic lands. If I still blank on a word despite the cue, I replace it. The goal isn’t an Anki deck of dead jokes—it’s to *tag* the unstickiest words with a signal strong enough that forgetting them is harder than remembering.

---

## Bottom line

For 90% of vocabulary, ordinary review plus exposure works. But for the 10% that resist, brute force fails. That’s when I hack the system. I load the word with humor, absurdity, or vivid characters, because those force attention. The effort of making the cue, plus the attentional tag, gives it a place in memory that plain repetition never will.

It’s a scalpel, not a hammer. And it works.
