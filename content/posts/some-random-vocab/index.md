summary: Some AI generated images for Tunisian vocabulary words.
---
I wanted to make some images for my Anki cards to incorporate mnemonics and have a visual element to help with retention. I didn't want to draw them by hand as I haven't really had time to illustrate things lately - so I used various AI tools. Originally, I used DaVinci - but that was terrible. Eventually I had DALL-E 3 inside GPT-4o generate the images for me. I received a lot of odd lecturing about body shaming and restrictions - but eventually I got something usable.

For much of this my pronounciation is very off. I apologize for any confusion caused.
