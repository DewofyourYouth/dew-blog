I started learning Turkish knowing **exactly zero words**.

I took Duolingo’s placement test, made some educated guesses based on context and structure, and was promptly placed in **Section 2**.

This was my first indication that something in the system was off.

Duolingo quickly taught me how to score points in Turkish exercises. But it quickly became clear to me that I hadn’t been taught how to say anything I’d actually need. 

For a native English speaker, some early grammatical guidance in Turkish is not a burden but a help. Turkish syntax is systematic enough that understanding the structure upfront is more efficient than hoping it will emerge implicitly over time.

And more fundamentally, it seems backwards to learn sentences like _“the woman and the artist drink milk”_ before learning how to say _“good morning”_ or _“how are you?”_—phrases that actually let you exist in the language.

## Some Basic Phrases

Before animals, colors, or abstract sentences, there are a few phrases that let you survive.

{{< admonition type=warning title="A note on the audio recordings:">}}
These recordings reflect *my* pronunciation at a very early stage. I started learning Turkish this week, and I didn’t have time to record audio for every phrase, so treat the recordings that are present as provisional rather than authoritative.

For correct pronunciation, consult the IPA provided. If you don’t read IPA, you can use [IPA Reader](https://ipa-reader.com/) to hear a neutral rendering based on the transcription.

If you can say these, you can keep learning _inside_ a conversation.

## Turkish as a “Glue” Language

Turkish builds meaning by **attaching it**.

Very little happens inside a word. Almost everything happens _after_ it.

The technical term for this is _agglutinative_, but “glue” captures the experience better. Meaning is stacked in a fixed, visible order. Once you see the order, Turkish stops feeling expressive and starts feeling executable.

---

## The Order Is the Key

Turkish does not let you improvise the structure.  
Meanings appear in a **predictable sequence**.

That’s the whole trick.

---

## How Nouns Stack Meaning

The basic order for nouns is:

> **root → possession → plural → case → modifiers**

### Root

The thing itself.

- **ev** – house
- **kitap** – book

---

### Possession

Who owns it.

- **ev-im** – my house
- **ev-in** – your house
- **ev-i** – his/her house

If there is a named owner, **both sides must be marked**:

- **Ali’nin evi** – Ali’s house
    - Ali-nin = Ali (marked as “of”)
    - ev-i = house (marked as owned)  

Turkish insists on symmetry.

---

### Plural

Plural comes _after_ possession.

- **ev-ler-im** – my houses
- **kitap-lar-ı** – their books

---

### Case (instead of prepositions)

Location, direction, and source are glued on.

- **ev-im-de** – in my house
- **ev-im-den** – from my house
- **ev-im-e** – to my house

---

### Stacking example

**arkadaş-ım-ın ev-ler-i-n-de**  
my-friend-OF house-PL-HIS-in

= _in my friend’s houses_

There is no ambiguity; the structure determines the meaning.

---

## How Verbs Stack Meaning

Verbs follow an even stricter sequence:

> **verb root → negation → tense/aspect → mood → person**

### Example: “I don’t understand”

**anla-ma-yor-um**

- **anla** – understand
- **ma** – not
- **yor** – ongoing / present
- **um** – I

Literally:

> _I am not understanding_

Naturally:

> _I don’t understand_

Swap the root, keep the structure:

- **bil-mi-yor-um** – I don’t know
- **iste-mi-yor-um** – I don’t want

Once you learn the order, you’re no longer memorizing sentences. You’re assembling them.

---

## Closing Thought

Turkish is explicit.

Meaning is not carried by word order, helper words, or irregular forms. It is attached, visibly, in a fixed sequence. If you know the order, you can see what a word is doing. If you don’t, you can’t.

Duolingo is effective at training recognition and pattern-matching within its own exercises. What it postpones is making that underlying order legible early on.

That delay matters, because without the order, vocabulary remains inert.
