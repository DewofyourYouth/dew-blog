> In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, when I was in the community of exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.\
> --- Ezekiel 1, 1

Today is the fifth of Tammuz, year 5784.

On the fifth of Tammuz, year 3332, Ezekiel saw vision of God in exile.

Somewhat more recently, on fifth of Tammuz, year 5733, my father's cousin, Rabbi Shmaria Shore, made Aliya to Israel and embarked on his path of teshuva.

Even more recently, on the fifth of Tammuz, 5744, I was born to Scott and Valerie Shore in Boston, Massachusetts.

Yesterday in Daf HaYomi, we learnt that the book of Ezekiel wasn't written by Ezekiel, but rather, by the men of the Great Assembly. This was because prophesies are not to be written down in exile. It had to wait until the men of the Great Assembly returned to Israel, in order to have a lasting effect of the generations of Jews.

> When Rabbi Zeira ascended from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, he fasted one hundred fasts so that he would forget the Babylonian method of studying Gemara, so that it would not hinder him. \
> --- Bava Metzia, 85a

It's odd that sometimes, the visions of exile must come to Israel to be written down. And yet, they are _indeed_ visions of God!! Despite Rabbi Zeira's 100 fasts, it is the Daf HaYomi of the **Babylonian's** that we're learning here in Israel and the vision of Ezekiel's in exile in which the Chariot of God is revealed to us. Even the Torah itself, was given to us outside of Israel - to give us directions for when we arrive to the Holy Land.

Rashi explains that the reason Rabbi Zeira wanted to forget the Torah of Babylonia is because

> Trust in Hashem and do good, dwell in the land and sheppard faith. \
