summary: I will now start a weekly vlog in Hebrew - similar to what I do with the Daily Derja.
---

Recently, I started making a daily vlog in Derja (Tunisian Arabic) to force myself to use it every day. I have now decided that I will do this weekly for Hebrew. (I haven't yet determined the day of the week I'll be doing it on.)

My Hebrew works fine day to day, but it doesnâ€™t hit with the sharpness I want. I work in Hebrew every day, but I still feel like I come off more articulate and wittier in English. The only way to fix that is to speak more, record it, and put it out there. Once you get over the weirdness of vlogging, it's really not that bad! ðŸ˜…

So once a week, Iâ€™ll post a short video. Not polished, not scriptedâ€”just practice in public.

Thatâ€™s the whole plan. To get all my vlog posts **follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-rJLeLJVWLKQKnXyLkw3bw)**
