        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/pesachim-rif-review-1/feather.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Pesachim Rif Review 1" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-rif&#34;&gt;The Rif&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the night of the 13th of Nissan (next day being the 14th) on must check for ḥametz in any place where ḥametz is brought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any place where ḥametz is not brought, one is not required to check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wine cellar stuff (which we&amp;rsquo;ll cover later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The תנא said אור instead of לילי to teach you to use the cleaner phrasing when speaking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ran&#34;&gt;The Ran&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-rationale-for-checking&#34;&gt;The Rationale for Checking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;רש״י says the obligation to check for ḥametz is to avoid a violation of בל יראה ובל ימצא.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This opinion is challenged by תוספות because we hold that, in order to avoid such a violation מדאורייתא, it is enough to nullify the ḥametz you own in your heart. Later in the גמרא we will see that checking is not enough, and one is still required to nullify. As such it should be impossible to avoid a violation just by checking alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ר״ן defends רש״י&amp;rsquo;s opinion by claiming that the obligation to nullify even after checking for hametz is מדרבנן. One could fulfill the obligation מדאורייתא with either checking or nullifying. The reason חז״ל required one to also nullify was in case someone finds an appealing cake in a place that it normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ran-further-clarification-of-nullification-ביטול-and-removal-ביעור-of-ḥametz&#34;&gt;Ran: Further Clarification of Nullification (ביטול) and Removal (ביעור) of Ḥametz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ר״ן then says that he see there is a lot of confusion around this topic and so, he further clarifies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The source for the nullification of ḥametz is either from תשביתו שאור מבתיכם (שמות י״ב) according to רש״י and apparent from אונקלוס, or from לא יראה לך according to תוספות based on a ספרי.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nullification is similar to הפקר but not actually the same thing, since:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we see it can be done in one’s heart (without verbally saying so).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declaring one’s property “like the dust of the earth” would not be enough to actually make it הפקר.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to R’ Yossi, הפקר only leaves your possession when someone else takes it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is because ḥametz during Pesaḥ is not really in one’s possession. As such it’s easier to rid oneself of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proofs that checking for and removing of ḥametz works:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The גמרא later asks where we learn out that the checking should be done with a candle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a מחלוקת whether the ביעור must be done through burning, or if any form of destruction is enough and they compared it to נותר. This distinction and comparison only makes sense if we’re discussing a דאורייתא.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The case רש״י is referring to is where one didn’t do ביטול, so בדיקה and ביעור are required מדאורייתא.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The תנא of the משנה is of the opinion you can be יוצא ידי חובה even מדרבנן with בדיקה וביעור.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though ביטול is enough מדאורייתא, our Sages saw fit to require בדיקה וביעור.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly because ביטול is done in one’s thoughts, and they were worried people would be lenient and not completely from their hearts, so they also required them to check and remove, which is also sufficient מדאורייתא.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible they were worried that if someone had ḥamets lying around their house, they would come to accidentally eat it on Pesaḥ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;limits-of-the-obligation-to-check&#34;&gt;Limits of the Obligation to Check&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obligation to check for ḥametz only applies to places where there is known ḥametz or where it is normal to bring ḥametz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is impossible that the חשש of finding an appealing cake would cause someone to have retroactively violated בל יראה ובל ימצא because the Torah relies on חזקה. And if one has checked his property in all places where there is known or likely ḥametz, he has fulfilled his obligation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The חשש must therefore refer to the time from between his accidental finding of ḥametz during Pesaḥ and its destruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/chayei-sarah/hebron.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Chayei Sara - 5784" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;שאלות לשינון הפרשה עם רש״י והרמב״ן&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מניין למדו חז״ל ששרה אימנו הייתה כבת עשרים לחטא כשהייתה בת מאה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איפה נפטרה שרה אימנו ע״ה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מהו סמיכות הפרשיות של סוף פרשת וירא ותחילת פרשת חיי שרה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איפה קריית ארבע? למה נקראת כך?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה התורה מספרת לנו את הדו-שיח בן אברהם לבין בני חת?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;״&lt;strong&gt;פגעו&lt;/strong&gt; לי בעפרון בן צחר״ מהו פירוש המילה &lt;strong&gt;פגעו&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה אברהם אומר ״נתתי כסף השדה״ (בלשון עבר) והרי לא נתן?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה הפסוק ״עפרון יושב״ נכתב חסר? (״עפרון ישב״)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה נקראת מקום קבורת שרה אמינו בשם &lt;strong&gt;מערת&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;המכפלה&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מהו פירוש ״עובר לסוחר״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מה ביקש אברהם לקנות? מה קנה בסוף?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;״וישקל אברהם לעפרן״ למה שמו של עפרון נכתבה חסר?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה התורה אומרת לנו עכשיו שה׳ ברך את אברהם ״בכל״? מהו ריבוי מילת ״כל״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מדוע שלח אברהם את אליעזר למצוא אשה ליצחק ולא הלך עצמו?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה לא שלח את יצחק?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מהו תורף דברי השטר שמסר אברהם לאליעזר?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מהו החילוק בין ״וידבר לי״ לבין ״ויאמר לי״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איך היו ניכרים הגמלים של אברהם?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;על פי שבועתו של אליעזר לאברהם, מה היה מוטל על אליעזר לעשות במקרה שלא ימצא נערה הגונה ממשפחת אברהם להתחתן עם יצחק?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה לא רצה אברהם שיצחק שיתחתן עם כנענית?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מדוע רץ אליעזר?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מדוע רץ לבן?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איזה מתנות נתן אליעזר לרבקה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מה פינה לבן?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איזה מתנות נתן אליעזר למשפחת רבקה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;למה התורה מיחסת את בתואל לאמו מלכה ולא סתם אומרת ״בתואל בן נחור״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;כמה זמן רצו ״אחיה ואמה״ שתשאר רבקה להכין עצמה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ולמה אחיה ואמה ולא אביה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איפה זה ״באר לחי ראי״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;איך רבקה הכירה מיהו יצחק?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מי היא קטורה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מהו פירוש ״האהלה שרה אמו״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;מכיון שנתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק, מניין היו לו מתנות ליתן לבני קטורה?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;במה היה לאברהם ״שיבה טובה״?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;במה בירך ה׳ את יצחק אחרי מות אברהם?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>The Mashgiach זצ״ל</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/the-mashgiach/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 11:00:18 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/the-mashgiach/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/the-mashgiach/flame.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Mashgiach זצ״ל" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the devastating news of the passing of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל, the news that the משגיח, Rabbi Mordechai Zelig Schechter זצ״ל has passed just a few short weeks later, is a lost that brings to mind the the verse in Yishaiah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;על מה תכו עוד תוסיפו סרה כל ראש לחלי וכל לבב דוי&lt;br&gt;
Why do you seek further beatings, &lt;br&gt;
That you continue to offend? &lt;br&gt;
Every head is ailing, &lt;br&gt;
And every heart is sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva, the one who sits at the head of the yeshiva, and the Mashgiach, the heart of the yeshiva, have been struck in such a short time. Oy! How far have we strayed to be stricken like this!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the passing of the משגיח זצ״ל didn’t come as a total surprise. He had a prolonged two year battle with cancer ר״ל.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways it’s impossible to discuss the Mashgiach זצ״ל without also discussing his father זצ״ל . In many ways he was the embodiment of the teachings of Rav Hutner זצ״ל and his father. But the contrast of demeanor between the Mashgiach and his father could not have been more stark. The Rosh Yeshiva was someone who was to be approached with awe, and who the burden was on the talmid to &lt;em&gt;shtell tzu&lt;/em&gt;, to put in the effort to understand what he was saying. The Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל demanded to live up to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; standards. The Mashgiach on the other hand, could speak to anyone on their level. He knew how to speak נגד רוחו של כל אדם, to the spirit of each person. To distill all the depth of the worlds of his father and Rav Hutner זצ״ל into something that we could relate to on whatever low level we were at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humility of the Mashgiach was something to behold. He wouldn’t put on airs or make you feel small when talking to him. Every conversation I had with him left me feeling edified and like I had just gained insight. But also,I always had the feeling that the Mashgiach had enjoyed talking with me as much as I enjoyed talking to him. I don’t think I was just fooled by his kind demeanor. I think the Mashgiach genuinely loved his &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My relationship with the Mashgiach started on the day he let me into the Yeshiva. He encouraged me to come to Chaim Berlin and had encouraged my learning and personal growth ever since. When I came to Chaim Berlin, in the middle of the zman, I thought if I got accepted I would be allowed to come next zman. The Mashgiach told me to go home, pack my bags, and come immediately. If he hadn’t done that, who knows if I would’ve ever made good on my commitment to go to Chaim Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Mashgiach was not only a source of support, he was also a source of inspiration. He was a poetic soul and a deep thinker who was always there to share his insights. When I was developing my own ideas and thoughts, he was always keen to discuss and refine them with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of his poetic nature and his encouragement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He once told me that it was important that I realize what I was. That &amp;ldquo;you are a fresh breeze that came in blowing the dust off of these old seforim&amp;rdquo; (pointing to the Chaim Berlin library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point he was sick in bed with the flu for a week. When he came back he came and sat next to me during first seder to share with me that, during the time he was in bed he was meditating on the מהר״ל (גור אריה) on the verse מקדש ה׳ כוננו ידיך - that something done with two hands is something you put your whole self into. “Hashem doesn’t ask us to subjugate ourselves to him to become lifeless, passionless, passive automatons. Hashem wants us to serve him with &lt;strong&gt;both hands&lt;/strong&gt;! With vigor and passion, full of life and power! Like knights on galloping horses, charging full speed towards the enemy full of strength and force of will!!” He then apologized for disturbing me during Seder on account of wanting to share that with me. (NOTE: I don’t remember what the גור אריה actually said, this is just my account of what the משגיח זצ״ל said)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed much of what the Mashgiach said was specific to circumstances, but planted a seed. In these cases, I was able to absorb the actual message immediately, but the underlying perspectives that went into what was said had a prolonged effect over time. I used to try to go to the Mashgiach’s home for סעודה שלישית. That was the time when he would generally wax philosophically. I’m certain that many of my life insights were formed from those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his brother in law passed suddenly, the Mashgiach took some of his young children to raise in his home. He would walk every Shabbos to boro park to make kiddush for his widow and give attention to his other children. I remember that once, when I was engaged to be married, I needed to discuss something with him. He suggested that we talk on his walk to Boro Park that Shabbos. I remember besides whatever I had to discuss with him, we also covered various topics, like Kabbalistic disagreements between the Chassidim and the Perushim and the philosophy of Radiziner Chassidus (his brother in law was a scion of the Radziner Rebbe). It was a truly uplifting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments about the משגיח זצ״ל are welcomed below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don&#39;t Waste Time Talking With The Cow</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/father-speech/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 20:13:23 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/father-speech/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/father-speech/DSC_1793.JPG" alt="Featured image of post Don&#39;t Waste Time Talking With The Cow" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family and friends thank you for joining us on this auspicious occasion! You’re being here has &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; enhanced our simcha. A special thanks to the Rebbe &lt;em&gt;Shlita&lt;/em&gt; who has seen the potential in Eliyahu, and has become such a positive influence in his life and ours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliyahu it is a great honor for me to stand here and address you as you take your journey into manhood. Your mother and I are so proud of the strides you’ve made to get here and we know you’ll continue to make us proud as you &lt;strong&gt;blossom&lt;/strong&gt; into a true man of character and a תלמיד חכם. Or, as Rabbi Zaks once put it, you have a bright future ahead of you as a תלמיד חכם, but maybe not as a professional soccer player!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were called to the Torah yesterday, I was זוכה to say the blessing ברוך שפטרני מעונשו שלזה “blessed is he who has exempted me from the punishment coming to this boy”.&lt;br&gt;
So actually, besides being a birthday for you, this is also a retirement party for me. Until now you were the responsibility on you mother and me. &lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re on your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt;, kid! As such, we feel it’s only right to send you off with some thoughts ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I would like to discuss three things with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;יראת שמיים&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not wasting time talking with the cow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;יראת-שמיים&#34;&gt;יראת שמיים&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday, you read beautifully
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now what does Hashem your G-d ask from you, but to fear Hashem your G-d, to walk in all of His ways and to love him and serve him with all your heart and soul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From here are sages have taught, all comes from Heaven except for fear of Heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliyahu, you have a lot of potential. But you intelligence. Your strength. Your innate middos - are gifts from the באשעפר!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the moral decisions you make, the values you live by, and your יראת שמיים&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-a-man&#34;&gt;Be a man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming a man means many things,
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking responsibility for yourself and the כלל&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being decisive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and not making excuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s another aspect of being a man I would like to focus on today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Dovid Hamelech passed the kingship on to his son Shlomo, which are חז״ל tell us was also on his bar mitzva, he told him: וחזקת והיית לאיש.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ralbag (Gershonides) - &lt;strong&gt;וחזקת והיית לאיש.&lt;/strong&gt; רוצה לומר שלא תהיינה פעולותיך פעולות צעיר שנים ונער אבל תהיינה פעולות איש גדול וזה אמנם יהיה עם ההתישבות עצה:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your deeds should not be like though of an young, inexperienced lad, but they should be like the deeds of a &lt;strong&gt;great man&lt;/strong&gt; and this will be done with COUNSEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be that guy who is to &amp;ldquo;manly&amp;rdquo; to ask directions - being a man means getting help when you need it and seeking good counsel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your mother and I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll count us among your good counsellors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-waste-time-talking-with-the-cow&#34;&gt;Don’t waste time talking with the cow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jews in Chernigov needed a new Rabbi, they turned to their spiritual leader, the Tzemach Tzedek, the 3rd Rebbe of Lubavitch, to find the a proper candidate. He sent them his prized students, Rabbi Dovid Tzvi Chen, a great scholar, known for his brilliance as well as piety, to serve in the new position. You can image his surprise when he got complaints that the new rabbi was &amp;ldquo;too lenient&amp;rdquo;. The Tzemech Tzedek determined to get to the bottom of this the next time his student came to visit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was, that the next time Rav Chen went to visit his Rebbe, the Tzemach Tzedek asked him, ‘what’s the deal with this &lt;strong&gt;lenient&lt;/strong&gt; rulings?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rav Chen’s response was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I return my soul to my Maker, I fully expect to have to give account for each one of my rulings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine I’m sitting in my office, and the village butcher comes to me with a cow that he has a שאלה about. As I inspect the cow, I quickly realize that according to the ש&amp;quot;ך’s opinion this cow is undoubtedly kosher, but according to the ט&amp;quot;ז’s opinion, there may be an issue. And now it is up to me to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I rule with leniency, I can full expect that, when I’m called before the heavenly court, the ט&amp;quot;ז will be there waiting for me to account for ruling against his opinion. I will reply that the ש&amp;quot;ך rules leniently on the matter - and I suspect a debate might ensue. Perhaps I’ll emerge victorious, perhaps I won’t - but either way - I’ll have spent an hour or so talking in learning with the ש&amp;quot;ך and the ט&amp;quot;ז! What could be better than that? I’ve already כאפט א שטייקל גן עדן!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I rule stringently, I fully expect that the cow will be up there waiting for me to answer why it was deprived of the זכות of adorning a שבת table and being consumed by a Yid! Perhaps I’ll be vindicated, perhaps the cow is right! But &lt;em&gt;oy gevalt&lt;/em&gt; if I’m going to spend an hour of my time - arguing with a cow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliyahu, life is &lt;strong&gt;too short&lt;/strong&gt; to waste time רעדן מיט א קו!
Find a good חבורה!
Find friends and mentors that bring out the best in you!
Pay no mind to the critics and the naysayers!
Especially, pay no mind, to that naysayer, that lives in your heart.
Don&amp;rsquo;t feed the trolls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliyahu, your mother and I are so proud of the man your becoming, and we know you have what it takes to וואקס א תלמיד חכם and to achieve great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;לחיים&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-september-1st&#34;&gt;Friday, September 1st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to sleep late last night. I wasted time when waking up. I’m baruch Hashem davening with a minyan generally 3x a day. I did have time to learn some mussar before davening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunday-september-3rd&#34;&gt;Sunday, September 3rd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;morning&#34;&gt;Morning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I davened at the 6:15 minyan at Zichron Moshe. I did come a bit late. Even so, that minyan is very, very fast. It may be better just to go to the 7am. Even with skipping I can’t keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the time in between with my family. It may be helpful to set a specific time for these activities. Otherwise, they have a tendency to cause tunnel vision where if I haven’t done &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them, I feel guilty about relaxing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the task of putting all my I want to accomplish everyday in a multi dimensional matrix is too daunting. A day is a dynamic chunk of time. Many times it seems impossible to even know in advanced. I suppose that’s what these logs are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m actually happy with the scope of your resolutions. They were a bit of a reach, but they seem doable. Many times I think to myself I should up the ante, but I think that sometimes I’m just looking to give myself an excuse to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the נץ minyan at Aish Kodesh is great and I’d really rather go there every day. But I’m concerned that if I do that I’ll burn out. Waking up at 6 is already early for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve fallen a little behind in Daf Hayomi. We going through the עבד עברי sugyot. A bit of a slog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evening&#34;&gt;Evening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very, very tired. Not feeling so well. Have a headache. I think it’s from the AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sort of lied. Someone said he wakes up at 5am every morning. I asked him why he does that. Someone else there asked my “but don’t you also wake up then?” I replied: “Yeah, but I know why I wake up early, but why does he?” (I live in בית שמש and commute to TLV after davening, this person lives in TLV.) I should’ve corrected him that I don’t wake up at 5, I wake up at 6. Counting as lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly caught up in Daf HaYomi but am still a little behind. Still l learnt more than a Daf (almost 2) so counting it. I learnt mussar on the train to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is leining at school tomorrow morning. I had to help him. I ended up going to sleep late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-september-4th&#34;&gt;Monday, September 4th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up and woke up Eliyahu to practice his leining before shul. I went to the 6:40 minyan at KSY. It&amp;rsquo;s a much farther walk than Zichron Moshe, but the pace is somewhat better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to WFH today, and I think also on Thursday. Better to be in a &lt;em&gt;shul&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;krias hatorah&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Daf HaYomi today! 😌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-_lmKdJ7ZpfgfUV1Gm1zYOW8gRP5b75D2Qj52uR6KuA/edit?usp=sharing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Eliyahu&#39;s Bar Mitzva Speech</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/eliyahus-bar-mitzva-speech/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 10:10:48 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/eliyahus-bar-mitzva-speech/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/eliyahus-bar-mitzva-speech/DSC_1772.JPG" alt="Featured image of post Eliyahu&#39;s Bar Mitzva Speech" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parshas Eikev it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ואכלת ושבעת וברכת את ה׳ א-לוהיך על הארץ הטובה אשר נתן לך&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from here we learn the concept of ברכות הנהנין.
מדאורייתא this only applies to someone who has become satisfied from eating bread.
However, חז״ל tells us, that one is forbidden to enjoy anything from this word without a ברכה.
Then, they took the general obligation to say a ברכה and specified various ברכות for different types of הנאה.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The משנה in ברכות דף נ״ד עמוד א says as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;בנה בית חדש, קנה כלים חדשים, מברך שהחיינו וקיימנו והגיענו לזמן הזה &lt;br&gt;
If one build a new house, or buys new objects, he says the ברכה that he has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ברכה of שהחיינו is a ברכה that is said at a time of particular joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא on דף נ״ט עמוד ב tries to clarify,
Does one really need to say this ברכה &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; time he buys a new object!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא brings a מחלוקת between ר׳ הונא and ר׳ יוחנן
רב הונא says, our משנה is only referring to a case where - אין לו כיוצא בו - where he doesn&amp;rsquo;t own a similar item
But if he already &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; a similar item, he does not need to make a שהחיינו
However, רב יוחנן says he still must make a ברכה even if he already has such an item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא then says
it&amp;rsquo;s משמע from this - that the entire argument is about a case where he has a similar item already from inheritance, and then buys another one.
But - קנה וחזר וקנה - if he &lt;strong&gt;BUYS&lt;/strong&gt; the item, and then buys another one, even רב יוחנן would agree that you won&amp;rsquo;t need to say a שהחיינו.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;רש&amp;quot;י explains the difference as follows:
הואיל עניין קנייה חדש הוא אצלו צריך לברך
Since the experience of buying the item is new to him, he must make a ברכה.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא will now offer an איכא דאמרי
a different version of the מחלוקת between רב הונא and רב יוחנן
According to this איכא דאמרי - Rav Huna holds that our משנה is only referring to a case where it&amp;rsquo;s his first time &lt;strong&gt;BUYING&lt;/strong&gt; the item
but, קנה וחזר וקנה, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to say a שהחיינו.
However, רב יוחנן says he must still make a ברכה even in such a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא is then מדייק that if so, they all must agree, that in a case of אין לו כיוצא בו, where he has something similar from inheriting it and not from buying, he is מברך שהחיינו!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא tries to bring ראייה to the לישנא קמא, (the first version) by bring a ברייתא&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;מֵיתִיבִי: בָּנָה בַּיִת חָדָשׁ וְאֵין לוֹ כַּיּוֹצֵא בּוֹ, קָנָה כֵּלִים חֲדָשִׁים וְאֵין לוֹ כַּיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶם — צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ. יֵשׁ לוֹ כַּיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶם — אֵין צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ, דִּבְרֵי רַבִּי מֵאִיר. רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר: בֵּין כָּךְ וּבֵין כָּךְ צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who built a new house and does not already own a similar house, or purchased new items and does not already own similar items, must recite a ברכה. However, if &lt;strong&gt;he&lt;/strong&gt; already &lt;strong&gt;owns a similar&lt;/strong&gt; one, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to say a ברכה, this is the statement of Rebbe Meir. Rebbe Yehuda, on the other hand, says: In either case, he must recite a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא tries to reason that according the לישנא קמא this ברייתא makes sense:
Rav Huna is going according to Rebbe Meir and Rav Yochanan is going according to Rebbe Yehuda&amp;hellip;
But according to the לישנא בתרא we can understand how Rav Huna is like Rebbe Yehuda, but who does Rav Yochanan hold like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this ראייה is ultimately rejected with the following reasoning.
Rav Yochanan of the לישנא בתרא will tell you: Rebbe Yehuda will hold that you still make a ברכה, even in a case of קנה וחזר וקנה. If so, why are they arguing in a case of אין לו כיוצא בו?
להודיעך כחו דרבי מאיר - to tell the extent of Rebbe Meir&amp;rsquo;s ruling.
That even a case where he&amp;rsquo;s buying such an item for the first time, if he already has a similar item, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a שהחיינו.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The גמרא then asks, let the ברייתא tell us a case of קנה וחזר וקנה to tell us the extent to which Rebbe Yehuda requires a ברכה? The גמרא answers that it preferred to tell you extent of Rebbe Meir&amp;rsquo;s שיטה - because he &lt;em&gt;פטור׳ס&lt;/em&gt; you from saying a ברכה and כח דהתירא עדיף - the strength of leniency is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;רש״י in the beginning of ביצה explains כח דהתירא עדיף as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;דהתירא עדיף ליה - טוב לו להשמיענו כח דברי המתיר שהוא סומך על שמועתו ואינו ירא להתיר אבל כח האוסרין אינה ראיה שהכל יכולין להחמיר ואפילו בדבר המותר&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The תנא would rather show us the extent to which one is מתיר because he relies on his opinion and is not afraid to be מתיר. However, the extent to which a שיטה is אוסר (forbids something), proves nothing - because anyone can be מחמיר even on something which is מותר (due to a ספק)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, NOW COMES THE QUESTION: &lt;br&gt;
(Drumroll)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of כח דהתירא עדיף in this case is confusing. We know there is a כלל
(a general rule) - of ספק ברכות להקל -
if one is in doubt of an obligation to say a ברכה - he should be מיקל and not say the ברכה, so that he won&amp;rsquo;t say a ברכה לבטלה.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this the case, it&amp;rsquo;s the תנא that says you &lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; make a ברכה that must be certain of the obligation.
Maybe the reason Rebbe Meir says not to make a שהחיינו is because he is מסופק about the חיוב to say a ברכה in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ברייתא should
tell us the extent to which רבי יהודה is מתיר &lt;strong&gt;MAKING&lt;/strong&gt; a שהחיינו!!! That would be כח דהתירא עדיף! Rebbe Yehuda must not have any ספק about the חיוב ברכה here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;רבי עקיבא איגר in the גליון הש״ס seems to be bothered by this קשה and tells us to look in the רש״ל in פסחים ק״ב עמוד א&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, the רשב״ם uses the concept of כח דהתירא עדיף in a similar context of ברכות הנהנין and the רש״ל asks our question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ואני אומר אדרבא הכא הוא כח דהתירא - שמיקל לברך עוד- ולא חיישינן לברכה לבטלה&amp;hellip; &lt;br&gt;
And I say, the opposite is true, the כח דהתירא is the one who is מיקל to allow a ברכה and is not worried about a ברכה לבטלה&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The מהרש״א and the אליה רבא say a TREMENDOUS חידוש here!
They טענה that the general rule of ספק ברכות להקל, only applies to ברכות המצוות where the ברכה is not מעכב the מצווה! But for ברכות הנהנין - it is אסור to eat anything without a ברכה! ספק ברכות להקל does not apply to ברכות הנהנין!!
&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem that Rebbe Akiva Eiger would apply to this reasoning to our case as well. The כח דהתירא would go like רבי מאיר who is מתיר the הנאה of getting new objects, or building a new house - without a ברכה - if one already has similar objects or owns a home!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would certainly make our גמרא and the רשב״ם in פסחים make sense, and if you look in the הגהות רבי עקיבא איגר in שולחן ערוך you can see that he brings this להלכה! But what about the ים של שלמה, and all the פוסקים that hold ספק ברכות להקל on all ברכות, even ברכות הנהנין?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting ways to be מתרץ this. But I want to just share an interesting ב״ח in הלכות תפילין at the end of סימן כ״ט.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ב״ח says there&amp;rsquo;s a חילוק between שהחיינו and all other ברכות - since שהחיינו is a ברכה made על שמחה שבלבו - on the joy in his heart - even if he is not absolutely obligated - he is not making a ברכה לבטלה if he feels joy and is giving blessing to Hashem who has given him life, sustained him, and allowed him to reach this special time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly would like to give praise to thanks to Hashem for giving me life, sustaining me, and bringing me to this special time! I would like to thank each and everyone of you for coming to share this special time with me! Your being here has truly put JOY IN MY HEART!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;thank yous here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the time come when are all זוכה to say שהחיינו on a new שמחה
בביאת גואל צדק במהרה בימינו
אמן!!!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elul Logs</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-logs/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:48 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-logs/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I decided to publically post my &lt;em&gt;kabbolos&lt;/em&gt; for Elul 5783, I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, there&amp;rsquo;s a certain lack of צניעות in posting something personal like this. I also was worried about normalizing my personal failures by publicizing them. On the other hand, I wanted to hold myself accountable publically. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I expect or even want anyone to read this. Although, if you&amp;rsquo;re someone other than me reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re more than welcome to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like there are a lot of times where I&amp;rsquo;ve made a deal with myself in the future, and then let my future self down. I mostly wanted to document the contract I was making to myself. In that vein, I am going to post the a (very slightly) redacted version of my obsidian notes - although the only thing I will be redacting is the parts not relevant to the &lt;em&gt;kabbolos&lt;/em&gt; or that involve other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kabbolos-day-one&#34;&gt;Kabbolos Day One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-20th&#34;&gt;August 20th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up early and went to shul. Although there was a big gap between the waking up early and the going to shul. I woke up and was out of bed by 6:10 and then wasted time and watched youtube videos from then until 7:30. I had to daven at the 8:00 minyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was זוכה to learn a chapter of יתגבר כארי. &lt;br&gt;
I was זוכה to learn דף היומי.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-21st&#34;&gt;August 21st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;לא הצלחתי ללכת לישון או להתעורר מוקדם&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;למדתי דף היומי ( קידושין דף ח).
לא הסתכלתי ביוטיוב או כדומה לפני תפילת שחרית.
למדתי פרק בספר יתגבר כארי.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;שיקרתי לפחות פעם אחת. 😞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-22nd&#34;&gt;August 22nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I removed the YouTube app from my phone, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch YouTube before davening. But I slept through my alarm. As such I decided I should get a bunch of Elul themed songs for my alarm clock. I wasted a lot of time and went to the 8:30 shachris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did learn daf hayomi and 10 minutes or so of mussar today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I lied today. At least I can’t think of any lies I’ve said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bed at 10:59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-23rd&#34;&gt;August 23rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I went to bed on time. Today I woke up earlier than expected. I was able to daven at נץ החמה בע״ה! I was able to learn mussar before davening!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the daf on the train to work. Reviewed between mincha and maariv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to review the הלכות of ראש השנה through סוכות also בל״נ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-24th&#34;&gt;August 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up and went to the 6:15 minyan at Zichron Moshe. Unfortunately, I came a little late and was very rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt 10 minutes or so of יתגבר כארי and Daf HaYomi on the train. 2 סעיפים of הלכות ראש השנה on the bus on the way to the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to daven before the train. Davening on the train is squishy and kind of stressful 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-25th&#34;&gt;August 25th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל was נפטר yesterday. It was very distressing for me. I went to bed a little before 11, but it took me a long time to fall asleep. I counted it as a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to the 7 am shachris today but I got in at 7:04. I’m counting it as a success given the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I ”embellished” a story to the point where some of the facts were inaccurate. I counted it as a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-31st-unfinished&#34;&gt;August 31st (unfinished)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up at 6 and wasted a lot of time. While it did make it to the 7am minyan (at 7:02), I certainly wasted a good amount of time. That said, I looked at my August 20th post, I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve made progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I’ve noticed. One is that I’ve slacked off in logging my notes. I should really put a place in my spreadsheet for that. I think these notes are likely more important than the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is that, while I‘ve been doing Daf Hayomi rather consistently, I haven’t necessarily been doing the full hour part. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that, as expected, some days I&amp;rsquo;m into Daf Hayomi, and some days it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing it just to check a box or not to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, things not on the spreadsheet tend to be ignored. I think it would be ideal to have a situation where I&amp;rsquo;m on top of things and the spreadsheet is just there to be a place to store the data and notice trends, rather than a motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spreadsheet-so-far&#34;&gt;Spreadsheet So Far&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes about the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three possible values 0, 1, or -1
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 = Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 = Not Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-1 = See continuation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For lying, any deviation from the truth is automatically a -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For not getting distracted before davening, this is an inherently somewhat subjective. I am not a zen master who can maintain a state of &lt;em&gt;Mushin&lt;/em&gt; (no mind) until I take off my tefillin. If I was expedient in getting to Shachris and davening, I&amp;rsquo;ve given myself a 1. If I was a little lagging but nothing to terrible I gave a 0. If I was basically procrastinating and getting involved with random stuff I marked it a -1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Hebrew Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;English Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Minyan Shachris&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;7am Shachris (Shabbos 8:30)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;No Distraction&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mussar&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Daf Hayomi&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;No lies&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Sleep by 23:00&lt;/th&gt;

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gemara relates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: The fact that I am more incisive than my colleagues is due to the fact that I saw Rabbi Meir from behind, i.e., I sat behind him when I was his student. Had I seen him from the front, I would be even more incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see your teacher” (Isaiah 30:20). Seeing the face of one’s teacher increases one’s understanding and sharpens one’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.13b.5&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Eruvin 13b - translation from Sefaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third post in a series of posts about my Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Aaron Schechter זצ״ל. Each one of these posts is written in tears. This post was going to be the fourth post. There was another post I had started writing called “The Angels Have Defeated The Sages”, about the suffering and challenges the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל overcame without ever compromising his learning and &lt;em&gt;avodas Hashem&lt;/em&gt;. However, writing about the Rosh Yeshiva’s &lt;em&gt;yissurim&lt;/em&gt; was too painful for me at this point; the pain of his passing is too fresh. I have therefore decided to write about some my impressions of the Torah of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל, as the edicts of Hashem are straight, they gladden the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I usually preface what I’m writing with a disclaimer that these are just my personal memories and impressions of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל, in this matter it would be silly for me to do so. I’m not so delusional as to believe that anyone would think that I, little Yankel Shore, came to understand even a drop out of the broad oceans that were the Torah, or even the approach &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; Torah, of a giant like the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל. Everyone is already aware that all they can hope to hear from me are nothing more than the table scraps that fell from the Royal banquet! As such I will just apologize for my brazenness to even have the gall to talk about this matter. I hope the reader will forgive me on account of my grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-simple-reading-vs-the-reductionist-reading&#34;&gt;The Simple Reading vs. The Reductionist Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל would often emphasize the importance of understanding what the “pushite (simple / straightforward) pshat” was. But he would also emphasize that understanding the simple pshat, required making the effort to appreciate the proper context and the spirit in which something was said in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a simple example, in Parshas Balak, at the Shabbos table in Camp Morris, we learnt the following &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt; (Numbers 23:9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I see them from the mountain tops, &lt;br&gt;
Gaze on them from the heights, &lt;br&gt;
There is a people that dwells apart, &lt;br&gt;
Not reckoned among the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general context here is that Bilaam is hired by Balak to curse the children of Israel, but when he tries, Hashem turns his curses to blessings. The above phrase is part of his first attempt to curse the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “I see them from the mountain tops” is ambiguous both in English and in &lt;em&gt;Loshon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Kodesh&lt;/em&gt;. It could mean either, I see those who are on the mountain top, or I, who am on the mountain top, see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashi, in explaining this &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt;, brings the Medrash Tanchuma that says that “the mountain tops” refers to the great Patriarchs and Matriarchs who laid the foundation of the children of Israel. This implies that it is the children of Israel that are on the mountain top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramban, on the other hand, explains that Bilaam is referring to the fact that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; is viewing them from a mountain top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Ramban points out, the fact that Bilaam is looking down on the Jews from a mountain top is not controversial. The last &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt; in the previous &lt;em&gt;Perek&lt;/em&gt; says so explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student at the table asked the Rosh Yeshiva why Rashi, who usually explains things כפשוטו של מקרא, like the straightforward reading on the text, didn’t explain the &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt; like the Ramban’s interpretation, and then possibly add the Medrash as an alternative midrashic interpretation, as he does in many other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva first gave a very straightforward answer - in Bilaam’s ”curses”, he’s not giving a weather report, he’s waxing poetically in praise of &lt;em&gt;klal Yisroel&lt;/em&gt;. In poetry, the &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; meaning is not the same as the &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; meaning. Mentioning the fact that Balak brought Bilaam to a mountain top to &lt;em&gt;look down&lt;/em&gt; on the Jews is not really congruent with the gist of what Bilaam was saying. Especially the way our sages interpret the rest of the “curse” (as brought by Rashi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva then decided that this was a teachable moment. For the next five minutes or so, the Rosh Yeshiva gave us a schmooze where he corrected various confusions and misconceptions about what “pushite pshat” means and what it doesn’t mean. I could never in a million years expect to do justice to the depth of insight and the clarity of thought the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל imparted to us in those 5 or so minutes. I will just relate one phrase that for some reason, echos in my mind. The Rosh Yeshiva said that some think it’s a form of sophistication to be very reductionist and try to reduce the pshat to be as close to the literal meaning of the words. “This is not a form of sophistication,” the Rosh Yeshiva said, “it is a form of &lt;strong&gt;blindness&lt;/strong&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-minds-eye&#34;&gt;The Mind’s Eye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one summer, I had the opportunity to learn second seder with the Rosh Yeshiva זצ”ל in Camp Morris. We learnt Perek Arba Nedarim that Summer. Before seder, all sorts of people would come to make requests of the Rosh Yeshiva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, an &lt;em&gt;avreich&lt;/em&gt; came to get a &lt;em&gt;haskama&lt;/em&gt; on a book of diagrams he made for teaching children. I believe it was on the Tabernacle and the clothes of the Cohanim, but I don’t remember for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva looked at the sefer for a few moments, admired the artwork and accuracy of the diagrams. He then apologized to the author and said that he had no doubt he would get &lt;em&gt;haskomos&lt;/em&gt; from great Rabbonim, but that he could not give one. I don’t remember if the Rosh Yeshiva volunteered the reason, or gave it after being asked, but it came out that he was not keen on this kind of educational material in principle. He explained that a rebbe’s job is to help the &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; learn the &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;mishna&lt;/em&gt; and create an image in their mind’s eye from the source material and the &lt;em&gt;mefarshim&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not to show them a ready made picture that they can retrofit into the source material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunate are the eyes that merited to gaze upon the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל. Even if only from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Reverence for your Teacher as the Reverence of Heaven</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/reverence-of-your-teacher-as-the-reverence-of-heaven/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/reverence-of-your-teacher-as-the-reverence-of-heaven/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/reverence-of-your-teacher-as-the-reverence-of-heaven/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Reverence for your Teacher as the Reverence of Heaven" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua said: let the honor of your student be as dear to you as your own, and the honor of your colleague as the reverence for your teacher, and the reverence for your teacher as the reverence of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.4.12?lang=bi&amp;amp;with=all&amp;amp;lang2=en&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;From Avos Chapter 4, Mishna 12 - Translation by Sefaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second post in a series about my Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Aaron Schechter זצ״ל. I want to stress again, that I am neither qualified nor capable of writing a biography of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל. The Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s memory should not be confined to the musings of Lilliputians like myself. I am just recording my memories and the life lessons I learned whilst being blessed to live in the presence of a giant such as the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rejoice-with-trembling&#34;&gt;Rejoice with Trembling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve got the impression from my previous post, that the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל was a warm and cuddly Zeide figure, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;ve misled you. The protocols of decorum towards one&amp;rsquo;s Rosh Yeshiva in Chaim Berlin were extreme, even for regular Yeshivas. I&amp;rsquo;m told this was put in place by the previous Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Yitzchak Hutner זצ״ל. The Rosh Yeshiva was revered and feared by all. And he didn&amp;rsquo;t suffer fools gladly. Even so, the love that he had for his students was felt by us at all times. He was known for having a smile that would light up the room. He was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; known for the direct and no-holds-barred way he could express his disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of religion will often note the contradictory nature of the commandment to fear G-d, and the commandment to love G-d. Students of the Rosh Yeshiva have no problem appreciating how this is no contradiction at all. Because we felt the love of the Rosh Yeshiva, as well as his greatness of character, our love for him caused us to fear disappointing him even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unworthy-questions&#34;&gt;Unworthy Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never asked him, but I would imagine Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל was not a fan of the saying &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question&amp;rdquo;. Firstly, the word stupid is not a word that ever left the lips of the Rosh Yeshiva. He would view such verbiage as coarse and unbecoming of a Torah Jew. But more to the point, the Rosh Yeshiva would lambaste students for asking (what we&amp;rsquo;ll call) &amp;lsquo;unworthy&amp;rsquo; questions, with some regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A type of question the Rosh Yeshiva had particular contempt for was the lazy question. Where the questioner blurts out a question because he can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to expend the necessary mental resources to come up with the apparent solution himself. The Rosh Yeshiva saw his role as facilitating a student&amp;rsquo;s deeper understanding and thoughts in Torah. He was not going to do the thinking for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a certain student whom the Rosh Yeshiva loved dearly and took under his wing, who he felt was guilty of this laziness to a certain degree. In trying to rid him of this habit, he would occassionally dismiss an &amp;ldquo;offending&amp;rdquo; question asked by this person with verbal carnage that made everyone else in the room uncomfortable. Once he even kicked this person out of the room for asking a question. He then told everyone else present, when he saw us all, mouths agape in horror, that he did so &amp;ldquo;because he is a good man, and I can be sure that when he comes back he will be a greater man.&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;m not certain about the exact wording the Rosh Yeshiva used, but it was along those lines.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about this person, it is true what the Rosh Yeshiva said about him. He did come back a greater man. I never received anything near that level of harsh treatment. The Rosh Yeshiva knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;respect-for-all-students&#34;&gt;Respect for all Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, one thing needs to be made clear. While the Rosh Yeshiva could be harsh in response to a question or a behavior, he would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; treat the student himself with any form of disrespect. He would also demand that when referring to fellow &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt;, or anyone for that matter, they were referred to with the proper respect. For example, he would take umbrage with someone referring to the &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; as &amp;ldquo;guys&amp;rdquo;. Someone telling the Rosh Yeshiva that &amp;ldquo;so-and-so is a good guy&amp;rdquo;, would get a lecture about how the word &amp;ldquo;guy&amp;rdquo; is a diminutive term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parashas Bereishis, the Rosh Yeshiva would note regarding the verse (Genesis 2:15):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And HaShem took the Adam and placed him in the garden of Eden&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashi, on this &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt;, quotes a Medrash explaining that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean He picked him up and placed him in the Garden, but rather that He convinced him with words to go to the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did חז״ל know this?&amp;rdquo;, the Rosh Yeshiva asked, &amp;ldquo;How does he know the meaning isn&amp;rsquo;t simply that He picked him up and placed Adam in the garden!? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that the simple reading of the &lt;em&gt;passuk?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva answered, &amp;ldquo;No, the simple reading of the &lt;em&gt;passuk&lt;/em&gt; is like Rashi. The verb &amp;rsquo;to take&amp;rsquo; means different things in different contexts. A man is not a sack of potatoes that you pick of here and place there. When referring to men, &amp;rsquo;to take&amp;rsquo; means with words.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Rosh Yeshiva this was clear. Your fellow man was to be treated with dignity and respect becoming &amp;ldquo;the image of G-d&amp;rdquo; in which he was created. He was not a sack of potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;care-for-all-students&#34;&gt;Care for all Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva cared for all the students in the Yeshiva deeply. Even more than they knew. I could probably write a book about this alone. I will suffice it to say that some students in the Yeshiva would possibly be considered &amp;ldquo;weak students&amp;rdquo; or worse by most accounts. When I got a little closer to the Rosh Yeshiva, he would often inquire about these students. I think, given my background, he felt I could relate to, and help, students who were struggling. On numerous occasions, he asked me to learn with a bochur who was struggling for a &lt;em&gt;zman&lt;/em&gt;, instead of with the study partner I had planned to study with. He explained to me that the Torah you learn while lifting the spirits of a fellow Jew is &lt;em&gt;Toras Chessed&lt;/em&gt;, the Torah of kindness. He understood that it can be very disheartening for someone not thriving in a Yeshiva. He did all in his power to maintain a connection with these students and set them on a good path in life, even if it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be within the walls of a yeshiva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a certain young man in the Yeshiva who had a depressive temperament. On more than one occasion, the Rosh Yeshiva had me go check the dormitory to see if he was in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you find him there, tell him I would like it very much if he would come over to talk to me,&amp;rdquo; the Rosh Yeshiva would say, &amp;ldquo;because he&amp;rsquo;s a good man and I enjoy speaking with him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always be grateful to the Rosh Yeshiva for this. Not only for his care, but for the way he encouraged me to care, and gave me an awareness of being נושא בעול חבירו, shouldering your brother&amp;rsquo;s burden. We revered him, but all the while, we felt his love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gemara relates that Rabbi Elazar, another of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s students, fell ill. Rabbi Yoḥanan entered to visit him, and saw that he was lying in a dark room. Rabbi Yoḥanan exposed his arm, and light radiated from his flesh, filling the house. He saw that Rabbi Elazar was crying, and said to him: Why are you crying? Thinking that his crying was over the suffering that he endured throughout his life, Rabbi Yoḥanan attempted to comfort him: If you are weeping because you did not study as much Torah as you would have liked, we learned: One who brings a substantial sacrifice and one who brings a meager sacrifice have equal merit, as long as he directs his heart toward Heaven. If you are weeping because you lack sustenance and are unable to earn a livelihood, as Rabbi Elazar was, indeed, quite poor, not every person merits to eat off of two tables, one of wealth and one of Torah, so you need not bemoan the fact that you are not wealthy. If you are crying over children who have died, this is the bone of my tenth son, and suffering of that kind afflicts great people, and they are afflictions of love. Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: I am not crying over my misfortune, but rather, over this beauty of yours that will decompose in the earth, as Rabbi Yoḥanan’s beauty caused him to consider human mortality. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Over this, it is certainly appropriate to weep. Both cried over the fleeting nature of beauty in the world and death that eventually overcomes all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;From Talmud Bavli, Berahos 5b - Translation from Sefaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hamodia.com/2023/08/24/bde-harav-aharon-schechter-ztl-rosh-yeshivah-yeshivas-chaim-berlin/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;death of my Rosh Yeshiva&lt;/a&gt;, Rabbi Aaron Schechter זצ״ל came as a shock yesterday. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t been well for many years, and it was very hard to get in to see him. His memory was not what it used to be towards the end - I guess I had a lot of excuses for not staying in touch. The news of his passing hit me like a ton of bricks. It had been 8 years since I had last spoken with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left the Yeshiva to study in Kollel Avodas HaLeviim (Ner Israel) in Baltimore, the Rosh Yeshiva told me &amp;ldquo;Yankel, you&amp;rsquo;re not leaving Chaim Berlin, you&amp;rsquo;re bringing Chaim Berlin to Baltimore!&amp;rdquo; At this time of great loss, I try to to console myself by telling myself that I didn&amp;rsquo;t leave the Rosh Yeshiva, I bring him with me every day. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be so pretentious as to claim to be a &lt;em&gt;talmid&lt;/em&gt; of the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל, his &lt;em&gt;talmidim&lt;/em&gt; are great scholars and leaders of כלל ישראל. But when I was learning in Yeshiva Chaim Berlin, his presence demanded greatness from us! In consoling myself, I want to relate some personal stories I had with the Rosh Yeshiva זצ״לֹ that I take with me every day. This is the first of what will be a series of such stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-back-story&#34;&gt;The Back Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came to Chaim Berlin, at age 22, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t your typical Chaim Berliner. Now, anyone who knows anything about Chaim Berlin will be rolling their eyes at this statement because to be a &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; Chaim Berliner, you need to have gone to Chaim Berlin in preschool! So I guess what I mean to say is that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a typical Yeshiva bochur at all. My Yeshiva high school education ended with my being kicked out of Mesivta of Boston in December of my 12th-grade year. From then on I wandered around, enrolling and dropping out of various Yeshivas and Universities. Eventually, I found work as a video editor. At this point, I considered myself to be &amp;ldquo;an agnostic&amp;rdquo; and found myself drifting away from religious observance altogether. A dangerous situation involving a car prompted me to make a commitment to return to Yeshiva and give G-d &amp;ldquo;another try&amp;rdquo; if I survived. When I did survive, I immediately regretted making such a commitment. Even so, I had made a deal, and I had to hold up my end of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first contacted Rabbi Eliezer Fireman, my 10th-grade rebbe, I asked him how I could get into Lakewood. When he heard the nature of the deal I had made, he told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t think Lakewood was a good fit for me. He thought I would find it &amp;ldquo;stifling&amp;rdquo; and that Yeshivas Chaim Berlin would be a better fit. And so it was, that I called the Yeshiva to inquire about admissions, dusted off an old גמרא and prepared something to be tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-encounter-with-the-rosh-yeshiva&#34;&gt;My First Encounter With The Rosh Yeshiva&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, you can&amp;rsquo;t get accepted to a Yeshiva, without meeting with, and getting approved by, the Rosh Yeshiva. I was the exception. The day I came to be tested the Rosh Yeshiva was moving and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it there to test me. As such, I was interviewed by his son, the Mashgiach of the yeshiva, Rabbi Mordechai Schechter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Yeshiva, I got up early, made myself tea, and started heading down towards the בית מדרש for שחרית. When I got to the lobby of the Yeshiva, I encountered the Rosh Yeshiva. The Rosh Yeshiva approached me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good morning, who are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Yaakov Shore, I&amp;rsquo;m a new student in the yeshiva&amp;rdquo;, I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yaakov, where did you find that tea?&amp;rdquo;, the Rosh Yeshiva inquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva pointed to the tea in my hand. I found this question to be odd, but it was way earlier than I was used to being awake at that time and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to try to figure out what he was getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Downstairs&amp;rdquo;, I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then drink it downstairs&amp;rdquo;, the Rosh Yeshiva said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva was not keen on people standing around in the Yeshiva lobby, drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shabbos-table&#34;&gt;The Shabbos Table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaim Berlin is a relatively big yeshiva. But because it is an &amp;ldquo;in-town&amp;rdquo; yeshiva, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer meals on Shabbos. An &amp;ldquo;in-town&amp;rdquo; yeshiva used to mean a yeshiva in New York, although I&amp;rsquo;m told now it increasingly means a yeshiva in Lakewood. Either way, I was from New England, which placed me squarely &amp;ldquo;out of town&amp;rdquo;. As such, I had to go to people&amp;rsquo;s houses for Shabbos meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon found out that there were 8 spots for students to eat at the Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s house for Shabbos meals every week. I thought that would be interesting. In day-to-day yeshiva life, you don&amp;rsquo;t have much direct contact with the Rosh Yeshiva. I also assumed there would be a long waiting list, so I went to the person in charge of arranging the guests and quickly asked to be put on the list. When he asked me which meal, day or night, I wanted, I told him it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter, whichever was available first. He then clarified with me that was asking which meal I wanted to go to &lt;strong&gt;that Shabbos&lt;/strong&gt;. Can I go to both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought perhaps it was a fluke that there were spots available for that Shabbos. What I later discovered was that the Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s Shabbos table was not a typical Shabbos table experience. It would seem that most students preferred the normal Shabbos table experience. For one thing, the Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s wife, who had advanced-stage Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease, would be seated at her usual spot at the Shabbos table, this made some students uncomfortable. But I think the main reason bochurim didn&amp;rsquo;t like going to the Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s for meals was because there was &lt;strong&gt;absolutely no &amp;ldquo;shmoozing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; at the Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s table. For example, from what I can remember, the Friday night meal always went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kiddish would be made. It would be followed by the Hamotzi. So far this is a normal Shabbos meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s granddaughters would serve gefilte fish. So far still normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Rosh Yeshiva put down his fork, Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter would clear the fish plates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s grandson in charge of the meals would bring out and distribute חומשים.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva would start learning that week&amp;rsquo;s Torah portion, with Rashi and Ramban, out loud. No talking, other than questions related to the material the Rosh Yeshiva was learning then, was allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point the Rosh Yeshiva would close his חומש and his granddaughter would bring out the chicken soup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Rosh Yeshiva put down his spoon, Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter would clear the soup bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s grandson would bring out and distribute חומשים.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva would continue from exactly where he had left off in that week&amp;rsquo;s Torah portion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point the Rosh Yeshiva would close his חומש and his granddaughter would bring out the main course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Rosh Yeshiva put down his fork, Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter would clear the plates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva&amp;rsquo;s grandson would bring out and distribute חומשים.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva would continue from exactly where he had left off in that week&amp;rsquo;s Torah portion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point the Rosh Yeshiva would close his חומש and his granddaughter would bring out the dessert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that dessert was followed immediately by &lt;em&gt;bentching&lt;/em&gt; and there was no study session after that, but I&amp;rsquo;m not certain about this last point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a joke they say about these long sessions of study at the Shabbos table when all talking was forbidden. They say that when a Chaim Berliner gets married, at this first Shabbos meal in his new home, with his new wife, he motions to her and whispers &amp;ldquo;Honey, could you please pass the salt?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately saw the opportunity here to learn חומש from the Rosh Yeshiva. But sitting quietly all those hours definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do. So I came up with a plan. Every Friday, I would study that week&amp;rsquo;s Torah portion thoroughly with every Rashi and Ramban. If I&amp;rsquo;m being honest, I usually only did the first half of the Parsha, or whatever I thought we&amp;rsquo;d get up to. I&amp;rsquo;d plan out a bunch of, what I thought to be, clever and open-ended questions on the material. Since everyone else there was generally silent most of the time, I figured it would be like having a private study session with the Rosh Yeshiva!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I quickly found out that I would have to up the ante regarding my prep work by a large margin, if I wanted to ask questions that the Rosh Yeshiva deemed worthy of responding to in more than just one sentence or less, the general plan worked great! The meals, of course, got a lot longer than they used to be, and not everyone appreciated that, but I paid them no mind. I told myself that if they wanted to, nothing was stopping them from participating, except maybe their lack of familiarity with the source material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on this, I realize that was one of the ways the Rosh Yeshiva pushed us to grow. The Rosh Yeshiva knew full well what I was doing, but he knew that this was the driving force to me learning Chumash, Rashi, and Ramban every week. And learning them &lt;em&gt;well!&lt;/em&gt; I mean, who learns Chumash &lt;em&gt;well!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time, the Rosh Yeshiva smiled at me in the middle of a meal, put his hand on my hand, and said, &amp;ldquo;Yankel, I see you prepared שניים מקרא well this week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, today is Friday. Perhaps, I&amp;rsquo;ll go prepare this week&amp;rsquo;s סדרה for the Rosh Yeshiva this Shabbos.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 12:16:48 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-5783/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/elul-5783/honeycomb.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Elul 5783" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the new year of תשפ״ד comes closer and we find ourselves in the month on אלול. My resolutions for Elul through עשרת ימי תשובה:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up and &lt;strong&gt;daven with a minyan early&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to bed by 23:00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On days when I&amp;rsquo;m not davening on the train, daven with a minyan at 7 a.m. or earlier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On days when davening I&amp;rsquo;m on the train, get the train that leaves a 7:46 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before davening, don&amp;rsquo;t waste time watching movies, listening to podcasts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read from a mussar sefer for at least 10 minutes a day.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, the mussar should be related to waking up early / davening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up with &lt;strong&gt;daf hayomi&lt;/strong&gt; everyday during this period.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t rely on making up days on Shabbos etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it takes less then 1 hour to learn the whole daf with Rashi, either learn תוספות or review to complete &lt;strong&gt;at least 1 hour&lt;/strong&gt; of learning day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be מחזק in last years resolution not to &lt;strong&gt;lie&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be מחזק in trying to avoid lying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take note of all lies, embellishments, or obfuscations said over a day. Even subtle ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the tally in obsidian and a spreadsheet at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we all merit to כתיבה וחתימה טובה for the coming year 5784!&lt;/p&gt;
