        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/elul-5783-postmordem/review.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Elul 5783 Postmortem" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Elul I decided to try to formally set goals for myself and document what happened. Here&amp;rsquo;s are my thoughts on the results of my experience trying to change my behavior over last Elul. The details of the changes I was trying to make are &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/elul-5783&#34; &gt;posted here&lt;/a&gt;. The basic list was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up and daven early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a &lt;em&gt;mussar&lt;/em&gt; (ethical teachings) book for at least 10 minutes a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up with daf hayomi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t lie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-went-well&#34;&gt;What Went Well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things that went well with the experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By and large, I was able to keep to the program throughout the period I commited to (through Yom Kippur). Since the behaviors I chose were ones that I think are good, this itself is a good outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increased focus on honesty has lasted, I catch myself in process of obfuscating the truth, equivocating, or changing details of events - and stop myself from lying, more often than before, due to this exercize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-upshot&#34;&gt;The Upshot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was able to change to my behavior for a significant period of time, not many of my habits have changed. Lasting long term change is hard. But I did make some progress and learnt some things for the next iteration. Here are some of the insights I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;we-have-bad-behaviors-for-good-reasons&#34;&gt;We Have Bad Behaviors For Good Reasons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take waking up early (#1).
I would like to wake up early every morning.
It is a good practice.
If I go to sleep too late, it is hard to wake up early.
I often go to sleep late at night for good reasons.
There are three ways I can wake up early.
I could wake up early and go to sleep late,
but only a certain level of sleep deprivation is sustainable for any extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can override all the good reasons to be active at night - and go to sleep early anyways.
That is certainly how I did it over the Elul period.
This way of doing it, in my experience, is very stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to do it is to change my surroundings and scheduling to make it that I can do the things I used to do at night during the day.
This would be great, but it takes more wisdom and insight, and requires an ability to negotiate what you can change and what is immovable.
There are many things that I have no power over when they happen. Each situation needs it&amp;rsquo;s own negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to negotiate effectively, you need to quantify things like - how important is it really that I wake up on time?
For example, most people would agree that wanting to wake up at 5am is not a good enough reason to sleep through the night while one&amp;rsquo;s wife
is in labor - or to remain in bed if someone has a medical emergency.
Most would also agree that staying up until 3am to binge watch Netflix is not a good reason to wake up late on a regular basis.
But everything in between is wherein lies the rub!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; OK to binge watch Netflix after a particularly stressful day? &lt;br&gt;
How much bingeing is warranted? &lt;br&gt;
What about if a friend from America (7 hours behind) really wants to talk to you about something important (but not urgently time sensitive)? &lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of gray area here, especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a really good sense of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; you prioritize the virtue of being an early riser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this may be why the honesty one (#4) stuck better than the others. It was a repeat.
I had had a year to grapple with how important honesty is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;im-not-reading-the-right-mussar-ethical-books&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Not Reading The Right Mussar (Ethical) Books&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to read a very practical mussar book about waking up early.
Reading about how important it is to wake up early, how bad it is to wake up late, demonstrating the folly of not waking up early, giving practical advice about how to wake up early etc. got old really, really fast!!
In the end, I felt like I was reading a book full of &amp;ldquo;bla bla bla bla bla bla bla&amp;rdquo;!
The reading itself felt like some sort of punishment, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the urge to open the book once since the experiment.
I need to read something more intellectual stimulating and engaging if I&amp;rsquo;m going to make up habit of trying to edify myself ethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;do-one-thing-at-time---then-increment&#34;&gt;Do One Thing At Time - Then Increment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to behavioral changes like this, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to change 4 things at once.
Even though this sounds like the most obvious, I think this is the hardest.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard because, I think to myself, perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m capable of more, and if I am, why should I limit myself to doing just one thing?
Making an honest and objective assessment of your own limitations is important, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a simple thing to do and you&amp;rsquo;ll never do it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I think it more makes sense to &lt;strong&gt;just pick one thing&lt;/strong&gt;, and track your incremental progress in that one thing over a longer period of time. That way you can adjust your expectations based on previous performance, instead of deep introspection. I think this is what I will do in my next experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these insights are not super counterintuitive and some might even say they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;lsquo;common sense&amp;rsquo;, and yet, here we are! 😅&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elul Logs II</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-logs-ii/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 08:10:48 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-logs-ii/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-september-1st&#34;&gt;Friday, September 1st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to sleep late last night. I wasted time when waking up. I’m baruch Hashem davening with a minyan generally 3x a day. I did have time to learn some mussar before davening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunday-september-3rd&#34;&gt;Sunday, September 3rd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;morning&#34;&gt;Morning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I davened at the 6:15 minyan at Zichron Moshe. I did come a bit late. Even so, that minyan is very, very fast. It may be better just to go to the 7am. Even with skipping I can’t keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the time in between with my family. It may be helpful to set a specific time for these activities. Otherwise, they have a tendency to cause tunnel vision where if I haven’t done &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them, I feel guilty about relaxing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the task of putting all my I want to accomplish everyday in a multi dimensional matrix is too daunting. A day is a dynamic chunk of time. Many times it seems impossible to even know in advanced. I suppose that’s what these logs are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m actually happy with the scope of your resolutions. They were a bit of a reach, but they seem doable. Many times I think to myself I should up the ante, but I think that sometimes I’m just looking to give myself an excuse to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the נץ minyan at Aish Kodesh is great and I’d really rather go there every day. But I’m concerned that if I do that I’ll burn out. Waking up at 6 is already early for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve fallen a little behind in Daf Hayomi. We going through the עבד עברי sugyot. A bit of a slog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evening&#34;&gt;Evening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very, very tired. Not feeling so well. Have a headache. I think it’s from the AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sort of lied. Someone said he wakes up at 5am every morning. I asked him why he does that. Someone else there asked my “but don’t you also wake up then?” I replied: “Yeah, but I know why I wake up early, but why does he?” (I live in בית שמש and commute to TLV after davening, this person lives in TLV.) I should’ve corrected him that I don’t wake up at 5, I wake up at 6. Counting as lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly caught up in Daf HaYomi but am still a little behind. Still l learnt more than a Daf (almost 2) so counting it. I learnt mussar on the train to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is leining at school tomorrow morning. I had to help him. I ended up going to sleep late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-september-4th&#34;&gt;Monday, September 4th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up and woke up Eliyahu to practice his leining before shul. I went to the 6:40 minyan at KSY. It&amp;rsquo;s a much farther walk than Zichron Moshe, but the pace is somewhat better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to WFH today, and I think also on Thursday. Better to be in a &lt;em&gt;shul&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;krias hatorah&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Daf HaYomi today! 😌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-_lmKdJ7ZpfgfUV1Gm1zYOW8gRP5b75D2Qj52uR6KuA/edit?usp=sharing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Elul Logs</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-logs/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 09:10:48 +0300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/elul-logs/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I decided to publically post my &lt;em&gt;kabbolos&lt;/em&gt; for Elul 5783, I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, there&amp;rsquo;s a certain lack of צניעות in posting something personal like this. I also was worried about normalizing my personal failures by publicizing them. On the other hand, I wanted to hold myself accountable publically. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I expect or even want anyone to read this. Although, if you&amp;rsquo;re someone other than me reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re more than welcome to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like there are a lot of times where I&amp;rsquo;ve made a deal with myself in the future, and then let my future self down. I mostly wanted to document the contract I was making to myself. In that vein, I am going to post the a (very slightly) redacted version of my obsidian notes - although the only thing I will be redacting is the parts not relevant to the &lt;em&gt;kabbolos&lt;/em&gt; or that involve other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kabbolos-day-one&#34;&gt;Kabbolos Day One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-20th&#34;&gt;August 20th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up early and went to shul. Although there was a big gap between the waking up early and the going to shul. I woke up and was out of bed by 6:10 and then wasted time and watched youtube videos from then until 7:30. I had to daven at the 8:00 minyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was זוכה to learn a chapter of יתגבר כארי. &lt;br&gt;
I was זוכה to learn דף היומי.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-21st&#34;&gt;August 21st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;לא הצלחתי ללכת לישון או להתעורר מוקדם&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;למדתי דף היומי ( קידושין דף ח).
לא הסתכלתי ביוטיוב או כדומה לפני תפילת שחרית.
למדתי פרק בספר יתגבר כארי.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;שיקרתי לפחות פעם אחת. 😞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-22nd&#34;&gt;August 22nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I removed the YouTube app from my phone, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch YouTube before davening. But I slept through my alarm. As such I decided I should get a bunch of Elul themed songs for my alarm clock. I wasted a lot of time and went to the 8:30 shachris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did learn daf hayomi and 10 minutes or so of mussar today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I lied today. At least I can’t think of any lies I’ve said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bed at 10:59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-23rd&#34;&gt;August 23rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I went to bed on time. Today I woke up earlier than expected. I was able to daven at נץ החמה בע״ה! I was able to learn mussar before davening!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the daf on the train to work. Reviewed between mincha and maariv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to review the הלכות of ראש השנה through סוכות also בל״נ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-24th&#34;&gt;August 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up and went to the 6:15 minyan at Zichron Moshe. Unfortunately, I came a little late and was very rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt 10 minutes or so of יתגבר כארי and Daf HaYomi on the train. 2 סעיפים of הלכות ראש השנה on the bus on the way to the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to daven before the train. Davening on the train is squishy and kind of stressful 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-25th&#34;&gt;August 25th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rosh Yeshiva זצ״ל was נפטר yesterday. It was very distressing for me. I went to bed a little before 11, but it took me a long time to fall asleep. I counted it as a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to the 7 am shachris today but I got in at 7:04. I’m counting it as a success given the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I ”embellished” a story to the point where some of the facts were inaccurate. I counted it as a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;august-31st-unfinished&#34;&gt;August 31st (unfinished)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up at 6 and wasted a lot of time. While it did make it to the 7am minyan (at 7:02), I certainly wasted a good amount of time. That said, I looked at my August 20th post, I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve made progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I’ve noticed. One is that I’ve slacked off in logging my notes. I should really put a place in my spreadsheet for that. I think these notes are likely more important than the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is that, while I‘ve been doing Daf Hayomi rather consistently, I haven’t necessarily been doing the full hour part. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that, as expected, some days I&amp;rsquo;m into Daf Hayomi, and some days it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing it just to check a box or not to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, things not on the spreadsheet tend to be ignored. I think it would be ideal to have a situation where I&amp;rsquo;m on top of things and the spreadsheet is just there to be a place to store the data and notice trends, rather than a motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spreadsheet-so-far&#34;&gt;Spreadsheet So Far&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes about the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three possible values 0, 1, or -1
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 = Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 = Not Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-1 = See continuation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For lying, any deviation from the truth is automatically a -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For not getting distracted before davening, this is an inherently somewhat subjective. I am not a zen master who can maintain a state of &lt;em&gt;Mushin&lt;/em&gt; (no mind) until I take off my tefillin. If I was expedient in getting to Shachris and davening, I&amp;rsquo;ve given myself a 1. If I was a little lagging but nothing to terrible I gave a 0. If I was basically procrastinating and getting involved with random stuff I marked it a -1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Hebrew Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;English Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Minyan Shachris&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;7am Shachris (Shabbos 8:30)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;No Distraction&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mussar&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Daf Hayomi&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;No lies&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Sleep by 23:00&lt;/th&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/elul-5783/honeycomb.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Elul 5783" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the new year of תשפ״ד comes closer and we find ourselves in the month on אלול. My resolutions for Elul through עשרת ימי תשובה:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up and &lt;strong&gt;daven with a minyan early&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to bed by 23:00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On days when I&amp;rsquo;m not davening on the train, daven with a minyan at 7 a.m. or earlier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On days when davening I&amp;rsquo;m on the train, get the train that leaves a 7:46 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before davening, don&amp;rsquo;t waste time watching movies, listening to podcasts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read from a mussar sefer for at least 10 minutes a day.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, the mussar should be related to waking up early / davening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up with &lt;strong&gt;daf hayomi&lt;/strong&gt; everyday during this period.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t rely on making up days on Shabbos etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it takes less then 1 hour to learn the whole daf with Rashi, either learn תוספות or review to complete &lt;strong&gt;at least 1 hour&lt;/strong&gt; of learning day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be מחזק in last years resolution not to &lt;strong&gt;lie&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be מחזק in trying to avoid lying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take note of all lies, embellishments, or obfuscations said over a day. Even subtle ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the tally in obsidian and a spreadsheet at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we all merit to כתיבה וחתימה טובה for the coming year 5784!&lt;/p&gt;
